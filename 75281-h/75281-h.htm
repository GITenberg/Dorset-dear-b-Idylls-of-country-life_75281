<h2 class="nobreak">WITCH ANN.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Ann Kerley</span> had lived in great peace and contentment
for more than seventy-three years. Her neighbours considered
her a good plain ’ooman, who always had a kind
word for every one, and was so ready to do a good turn
for another body as heart could wish. But, lo and behold!
one fine morning old Ann Kerley awoke to find herself a
witch.</p>

<p>The previous day had been sultry and wild, with spells
of fierce sunshine that smote down upon honest people’s
heads as they toiled in cornfield or potato-plot, bringing
out great drops of sweat on sunburnt faces, and forcing
more than one labourer to supplement the shade and
comfort of his broad chip hat by a cool moist cabbage
leaf. Withal furious gusts of wind rose every now and
then—storm-wind, old Jan Belbin said, and he was considered
wonderful weather-wise—wind that set the men’s
shirt-sleeves flapping for all the world like the sleeves of a
racing jockey, and blew the women’s aprons into the air,
and twisted the maids’ hats round upon their heads if they
so much as crossed the road to the well. Yet this wind
would drop as suddenly as it had sprung up; the land
would lie all bathed in fiery heat, and a curious sense of
uneasiness and expectancy would seem to pervade the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
whole of Nature. The very beasts were disquieted in
their pasture; the corn stood up straight and stiff, each
ear, as it were, on the alert; not a leaf stirred in hedgerow
or tree-top; and then “all to once,” as Jan Belbin
pointed out, the storm-wind sprang up again, tossing the
golden waste of wheat hither and thither like a troubled
sea, and making every individual branch and twig creak
and groan.</p>

<p>Twilight was at last closing in with brooding stillness,
and a group of lads, who had been working for an hour
or two in the allotments, gathered idly round the gate,
gossiping, and some of them smoking, before proceeding
homewards. It was too dark, as Joe Pilcher declared, to
see the difference between a ’tater and a turnip, and ’twas
about time they were steppin’ anyways. He was in the
act of relating some interesting anecdote with regard to
last Saturday’s practice in the Cricket field, when he broke
off, and pointed up the stony path which led past the
allotments.</p>

<p>“Hullo! Whatever’s that?” he cried.</p>

<p>The bent outline of a small figure could be seen creeping
along the irregular line of hedge. It was apparently hump-backed,
and wore a kind of hood projecting over its face.</p>

<p>“’Tis a wold hag, seemin’ly,” said Jim Ford, craning
forward over the top rail.</p>

<p>“There!” cried Joe, “I took it for a sprite, but I don’t
know as I shouldn’t be just so much afeared of a witch
any day. It be a witch, sure.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be a sammy,” interposed an older man. “’Tis
nothin’ but some poor wold body what has been gatherin’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
scroff. They’ve felled a tree up-along in wood, an’ she’ve
a-been a-pickin’ up all as she can lay hands on for her fire.
There, ’tis wold Ann Kerley. I can see her now. She’ve
a-got a big nitch o’ sticks upon her back, an’ she do croopy
down under the weight on’t, an’ she’ve a-tied her handkercher
over her bonnet, poor body, to keep it fro’ blowin’
away. There’s your hag for you, Joe!”</p>

<p>“I be afeared, I say,” insisted Joe, feigning to tremble
violently. He considered himself a wag, and had quite a
following of the village good-for-noughts. “’Tis a witch,
sartin sure ’tis a witch. Don’t ye go for to overlook I,
Ann Kerley, for I tell ’ee I won’t a-bear it!”</p>

<p>As the unconscious Ann drew nearer he squatted down
behind the gate-post, loudly announcing that he was that
frayed he was fair bibbering. Two or three of the others
made believe to hide themselves too, pretending to shiver
in imitation of their leader; and peering out like him between
the bars of the gate.</p>

<p>Such unusual proceedings could not fail to attract the
old woman’s attention, and she paused in astonishment
when she reached the spot.</p>

<p>“Why, whatever be to do here?” she inquired.</p>

<p>Joe uttered a kind of howl, and burrowed into the hedge.</p>

<p>“She be overlookin’ of we,” he shouted. “The witch
be overlookin’ of we.”</p>

<p>“Don’t ye take no notice, my dear woman,” said Abel
Bond, the man who had before spoken. “They be but a
lot o’ silly bwoys a-talkin’ nonsense.”</p>

<p>“Witch!” cried Joe.</p>

<p>“Witch! witch!” echoed the rest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>Ann looked from one to the other of the grinning faces
that kept popping up over the rail, and disappearing again.</p>

<p>“Whatever be they a-talkin’ on?” she gasped.</p>

<p>“You be a witch, Ann,” cried Joe. “If you was served
right you’d be ducked in the pond. E-es, that you would.”</p>

<p>A small boy, fired with a desire to distinguish himself,
picked up a clod of earth, and flung it at her with so true
an aim that it grazed her cheek.</p>

<p>“Take that, witch!” he cried.</p>

<p>Joe, not to be outdone, threw another; pellets of earth
and even small pebbles began to assail the old woman
from the whole line.</p>

<p>Abel Bond promptly came to the rescue, knocking the
ringleaders’ heads together, and impartially distributing
kicks and cuffs among the remainder.</p>

<p>“Bad luck to the witch!” cried the irrepressible Joe,
wriggling himself free; and the shout was taken up by the
rest, even as they dodged the avenger.</p>

<p>“Bad luck, yourself,” retorted poor Ann, trembling with
wrath and alarm. “I’m sure nar’n o’ ye do deserve such
very good luck arter insultin’ a poor wold ’ooman what
never did ye no harm.”</p>

<p>And she went on her way, grumbling and indignant.</p>

<p>But when she had reached her own little house in the
“dip,” and had walked up the flagged path between the
phlox bushes and the lavender, and pussy had come rubbing
against her legs in greeting, her anger cooled; and by
the time her kettle had begun to sing over a bright wood
fire, and she had laid out her modest repast of bread and
watercress, she fairly laughed to herself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>“Lard! they bwoys be simple!” she said. “They did
call I a witch, along o’ my havin’ tied my handkercher over
my head. Abel did give it to ’em, but I reckon he didn’t
hurt ’em much. Bwoys! there, they do seem so hard as
stoones very near. ‘Witch!’ says they. Well, that’s a
notion.”</p>

<p>She chuckled again, and set down a saucer of milk for
the cat to lap.</p>

<p>“They’ll be callin’ you a witch next, puss,” said she
laughing.</p>

<p>Ann carried her bucket to the well as usual next morning,
feeling rather more cheerful than was her custom.
Rain had fallen shortly after daybreak, but the sky was
now clear and limpid, and the air cool. On her way to
the well her attention was caught by a loud clucking in her
neighbour’s garden, and looking across the dividing hedge
she descried a hen violently agitating herself inside a coop,
while a brood of yellow downy ducklings some few hours
old paddled in and out of a pool beside the path.</p>

<p>“Well, of all the beauties!” cried Ann, clapping her
hands together until the bucket rattled on her arm; “why,
Mrs. Clarke, my dear, you must have hatched out every
one—’tis a wonderful bit o’ luck.”</p>

<p>“E-es, indeed,” agreed Mrs. Clarke, “hatchin’ out so late
an’ all. I hope I may do well wi’ ’em.”</p>

<p>“I hope so, that do I,” agreed Ann heartily, and hobbled
on towards the well.</p>

<p>One or two women were there, who responded to
her greeting with a coldness which she did not at once
realise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>“Fine rain this marnin’,” she remarked cheerfully, as
her bucket went clattering down the well; “we’ve had a
good drop to-year, haven’t we? Farmers may grumble,
but, as I do say, ’tis good for the well. We’ll be like to
draw a bit less chalk nor we do in the dry seasons. There
be all sarts in our well, bain’t there? Water an’ chalk,
an’ a good few snails. There, when I do hear folks
a-talkin’ about the Government doin’ this an doin’ that,
I do say to myself, I wish Government ’ud see to our
well.”</p>

<p>Usually such a sally would have been applauded, but, to
poor old Ann’s astonishment and chagrin, her remark was
received on this occasion in solemn silence. To hide her
discomfiture she peered into the moss-grown depths of the
well.</p>

<p>“Don’t ye go a-lookin’ into it like that, Ann,” cried a
vinegary-faced matron in an aggressive tone. “Chalky
water, e-es, an’ water wi’ snails in’t is better than no water
at all. ’Tis sure—’tis by a long ways.”</p>

<p>“Ah, ’tis!” agreed the others, eyeing Ann suspiciously.</p>

<p>She straightened herself and looked round in surprise.</p>

<p>“I never said it wasn’t,” she faltered. “Why do ye look
at me so nasty, Mrs. Biles?”</p>

<p>“Oh, ye don’t know, I s’pose?” retorted Mrs. Biles
sourly. “How be your ’taters, Ann Kerley, this marnin’?”</p>

<p>“Doin’ finely, thanks be,” said poor Ann, brightening
up, as she considered the conversation was taking a more
agreeable turn.</p>

<p>“Not blighted, I s’pose?” put in a little fat woman who
had hitherto been silent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>“Not a sign o’ blight about ’em,” said Mrs. Kerley joyfully.
“There, I did just chance to look at ’em when I
did first get up, an’ they’re beautiful.”</p>

<p>“That’s strange,” remarked Mrs. Biles, with a meaning
sniff. “Every single ’tater at the ’lotments be blighted,
they do tell I. Mrs. Pilcher did say when her husband
went up there this marnin’ he could smell ’em near a
quarter of a mile away.”</p>

<p>“Dear, to be sure!” groaned Ann, sympathetically, being
quite willing to condone any little asperities of temper on
the part of folks suffering from such a calamity. “’Tis a
terr’ble pity, Mrs. Biles. There, ’tis along o’ the ’lotments
layin’ out so open like, I d’ ’low. Now my bit o’ garden
be sheltered.”</p>

<p>The little fat woman, usually a meek sort of body,
snorted fiercely.</p>

<p>“’Tisn’t very likely as your garden ’ud suffer, Mrs.
Kerley,” she cried, in a voice that trembled with wrath.
“Your garden is safe enough—an’ so was the ’lotments
till yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Well, I be pure sorry, I’m sure,” said Ann, looking
from one to the other in bewilderment. “’Tis just as luck
would have it, I s’pose.”</p>

<p>“Luck, indeed!” cried Mrs. Biles meaningly. “There’s
them as went by yesterday as wished bad luck, an’ bad
luck did come.”</p>

<p>Ann fairly gasped. Mrs. Biles threw out her hand
warningly.</p>

<p>“Take your eyes off I, Mrs. Kerley. Take ’em off, I
say! I bain’t a-goin’ to have ’ee overlookin’ of I, same as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
you did do to poor Joe Pilcher—’tis well if the poor bwoy
don’t die of it.”</p>

<p>Ann obediently dropped her eyes, a nightmare-like
sensation of oppression overwhelming her.</p>

<p>“I d’ ’low ye won’t deny ye did overlook Joe Pilcher,”
went on Mrs. Biles; “there, ye did no sooner turn your
back yesterday, nor the lad was took wi’ sich a bad pain
in his innards that he went all doubly up same as a wold
man.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s none o’ my fault,” expostulated Ann
warmly, for even a worm will turn. “He’ve a-been eatin’
summat as disagreed wi’ he.”</p>

<p>“Nothin’ o’ the kind!” cried the women in chorus.</p>

<p>“It comed so sharp as a knife,” added one, “all twisty
turny.”</p>

<p>“The poor bwoy did lie upon the floor all night,” put
in another, “a-pankin’ and a-groanin’ so pitiful. ‘Ann
Kerley has bewitched I,’ says he. E-es, the bwoy come
out wi’ the truth. ‘’Tis Mother Kerley what has overlooked
I,’ says he.”</p>

<p>“Well,” returned Ann vehemently, “I never did nothin’
at all to the bwoy. ’Tis nonsense what you do talk, all on
you. He’ve a-been eatin’ green apples—that’s what the
matter wi’ he.”</p>

<p>“Green apples!” exclaimed Mrs. Biles, with shrill sarcasm.
“Dear, to be sure, if a bwoy was to be upset every
time he ate a green apple, there wouldn’t be a sound child
in village. He hadn’t had above five or six, his mother
did say herself, an’ he can put away as many as fourteen
wi’out feelin’ the worse for it. Ye must agree ’tis very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
strange, Ann—there, ye did say out plain for all to hear:
‘Bad luck, yourself,’ says you to the innercent bwoy. ‘Ye
won’t be like to have such very good luck, nar’n o’ you,’
says you, an’, sure enough, there be the ’taters blighted,
an’ there be the poor bwoy upset in’s inside.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t really mean it, neighbours,” faltered Ann,
looking piteously round. “I was a bit vexed at the time,
an’ when the lads did start a-floutin’ me wi’ stones an’ that,
and a-callin’ ill names and a-wishin’ me bad luck, I just
says back to ’em, quick like, ‘Bad luck, yourself!’ an’
’twasn’t very like they’d have good luck; but I didn’t
mean it in my heart—not me, indeed. The Lard sees I
hadn’t no thought o’ really wishin’ evil to nobody—that
I hadn’t, neighbours. You don’t believe I did have, do
’ee now, Mrs. Whittle?”—turning in despair to the little
woman on her right—“you, what has knowed I sich a many
year—you did ought to know I wouldn’t wish no harm to
nobody.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Whittle looked sheepish and uncomfortable. Despite
the sinister aspect of things, her heart melted at her
old crony’s appeal.</p>

<p>“Why, I scarce can believe it,” she was beginning, when
Mrs. Biles struck in:—</p>

<p>“Deny it if you can, Ann Kerley. There’s the ’taters
blighted, an’ there’s the bwoy took bad, an’ it’s you what
wished ’em ill-luck. What can ye make o’ that, Mrs.
Whittle? Ye’ll ’low ’tis strange.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Whittle shook her head dubiously, and Ann, deprived,
as she thought, of her only ally, threw her apron
over her head, and wept behind it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>“Don’t ’ee take on, Mrs. Kerley, that’s a dear,” said
Mrs. Whittle, softening once more. “’Twas maybe a
chance thing. You did say them words wi’out thinkin’
an’ they did come true to be a warnin’ to ’ee. We do all
do wrong sometimes; this ’ere did ought to be a warnin’
to all on us.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure ’twill be a lesson to I,” sobbed Ann inarticulately.
“So long as I do live I’ll never say such things
again. ’Twas very ill-done o’ me to ha’ spoke wi’out
thought, sich a wold ’ooman as I be, an’ so near my end
an’ all, an’ the Lard has chastised I. I can’t do more nor
say I’m sorry, an’ I hope the A’mighty ’ull forgive me.”</p>

<p>“There, the ’ooman can’t say no fairer nor that,” said
Mrs. Whittle, looking round appealingly; “she can’t do
more nor repent.”</p>

<p>“Oh, if she do repent it’ll be well enough,” said Mrs.
Biles darkly. “’Tis to be hoped as she do repent. But
by all accounts ’tis easier for to begin that kind o’ work
nor to leave it off again.”</p>

<p>She turned on her heel with this parting innuendo, and,
taking up her full bucket, walked away. The others
followed suit, and Ann, left alone, sobbed on for a moment
or two with a feeling akin to despair, and then, drawing
down her apron, wiped her eyes with it sadly, wound up
her pail from the depths where it had lain forgotten, and
made her way homewards.</p>

<p>For days afterwards she was ashamed to show her face,
and rose at extraordinarily early hours in order to procure
her supply of water, and crept out of her own quarters at
dusk to make her necessary purchases.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>One morning, about a week after the affair at the allotments,
when Ann sallied forth as usual for water, she
paused incidentally to look over her neighbour’s gate.
The hen-coop was still in view, the hen cackling, and the
ducklings waddling up and down the path. But how few
of them there were! Only three! What could have become
of the others? Possibly they were squatting at the
back of the coop. She was craning her head round in
order to ascertain if this were the case, when a window in
Mrs. Clarke’s house was thrown open, and that lady’s
voice was heard in angry tones:—</p>

<p>“I’ve catched you at it, have I? I’ve catched you at
it! Well, you did ought to be ashamed of yourself, Ann
Kerley. To try an’ do me a mischief—me, as has been
sich a good neighbour to ’ee.”</p>

<p>“Why, what’s the matter?” returned Ann, backing away
from the gate, and raising dim, distracted eyes.</p>

<p>“I’ve catched you in the very act,” continued Mrs.
Clarke vehemently. “Says I to myself when the ducklin’s
kep’ a-droppin’ off like that, ‘I wonder if it can be
Ann?’ says I, an’ then I thinks, ‘No, it never can be
Ann; her an’ me was always friends,’ I says. Ah, you
ungrateful, spiteful creetur’!”</p>

<p>An arm, clad in checked flannelette, was here thrust forth,
and the fist appertaining thereto emphatically shaken.</p>

<p>“I’m sure,” protested the unfortunate Ann, staggering
back against her own little gate, “I don’t know whatever
you can mean by such talk, Mrs. Clarke; I never touched
your ducks. I be a honest ’ooman, an’ I wouldn’t take
nothin’ what didn’t belong to I.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>“I don’t say you stole ’em,” retorted Mrs. Clarke, “but
I say you overlooked ’em, an’ that’s worse; a body ’ud
know what to be at if ’twas only a thief as was makin’
away wi’ ’em, but when ’tis a witch—Lard, whatever is to
be done? I couldn’t ha’ thought ye’d ha’ found it in your
heart to go striking down they poor little innercent things.
What harm did they do ye? Sich beauties as they was.
But there, ye must go gettin’ up in the very dummet that
ye mid overlook the poor little creetur’s, so that, one after
another, they do just croopy down an’ die.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Clarke,” said Anne, solemnly and desperately,
“I can’t tell how sich a thing did come about—I can’t
indeed. ’Tis no fault o’ mine, I do assure ye. I wouldn’t
ha’ had they poor little duck die for anything. I never
wished ’em ill. I was admirin’ of ’em. I never had no
other thought.”</p>

<p>“Well, see here,” returned Mrs. Clarke, somewhat
mollified. “Don’t ye look at ’em at all, that’s a good
’ooman. Maybe ’tis no fault o’ yourn, but ’tis very
strange, Mrs. Kerley, what do seem to have come to you
to-year. You do seem to bring bad luck, though you
midn’t do it a-purpose.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure I don’t,” protested Ann, “an’ I can’t believe,
Mrs. Clarke, as a body can do bad wi’out knowin’ it.”</p>

<p>“Well, ’tis queer, I d’ ’low,” agreed her neighbour, “but
when a body sees sich things for theirsel’s as do happen
along o’ you, they can’t but believe their own eyes. Ye
mind that there bar-hive what Mr. Bridle got last
month?”</p>

<p>“E-es,” returned Ann feebly, “I mind it well. I never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
see sich a handsome contrivance nor so clever. Mr. Bridle
showed it to I.”</p>

<p>“E-es, I d’ ’low he did,” agreed the other, with a
certain triumph. “I d’ ’low ye was a-lookin’ at it a long
time.”</p>

<p>“I was,” confessed Ann, with a sinking heart.</p>

<p>Mrs. Clarke nodded portentously. “That’s it,” she said.
“The bees be all dead, Mrs. Kerley. Bridle, he did say
to I yesterday, ‘I couldn’t think,’ says he, ‘whatever took
the bees. I had but just moved them out of the wold
skip and they did seem to take to the bar-hive so nice,’
he says, ‘an’ now they be all a-dyin’ off so quick as they
can. I couldn’t think,’ he says, ‘what could be the reason,
but I do know now. I do know it was a great mistake to
ha’ brought Ann Kerley up to look at ’em.’”</p>

<p>“Oh dear, oh dear,” cried the last-named poor old
woman, wringing her hands, “do he really think I did
hurt ’em?”</p>

<p>“He do, indeed,” said Mrs. Clarke firmly. “There, my
dear, it do seem a terr’ble thing, but you be turned into a
witch seemin’ly, whether it be against your will or whether
it bain’t.”</p>

<p>Ann stood motionless for a moment, her hands squeezed
tightly together, her face haggard and drawn.</p>

<p>“I think I’ll go indoor a bit,” she said, after a pause.
“I’ll go indoor an’ set me down. I don’t know what to
do. Mrs. Clarke——?”</p>

<p>“E-es, my dear. There, you needn’t look up at I so
earnest—I can hear ’ee quite well wi’out that.”</p>

<p>Ann turned away with an impatient groan, and went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
staggering up her path. The other looked after her
remorsefully.</p>

<p>“Bide a bit, Mrs. Kerley, do ’ee now. What was ye
goin’ to ax I?”</p>

<p>“I was but goin’ to ax,” faltered Ann, still with her
face averted, “if you’d be so kind as to fetch I a drop
o’ water this marnin’ when you do go to get some for
yoursel’. There, I don’t some way feel as if I could face
folks—an’ there mid be some about. ’Tis gettin’ a bit
late now.”</p>

<p>“E-es, sure; I could do it easy,” agreed Mrs. Clarke
eagerly. “I could do it every marnin’—’tisn’t a bit more
trouble to fill two pails nor one. An’ ’t ’ud be better for
ee, Ann, my dear, not to go about more nor you can help
till this ’ere visitation wears of.”</p>

<p>“’T ’ull never wear off,” said Ann gloomily, as she
walked unsteadily away.</p>

<p>Now, as Mrs. Clarke subsequently remarked, those
words of Ann’s made her fair bibber, same as if a bucket
of cold water were thrown down her back. She was full
of compassion for her neighbour, and, though she was
willing to believe that the strange, unpleasant power of
which she had suddenly become possessed was unwelcome
to her and unconsciously used, she was nevertheless forced
to agree with Mrs. Biles that that didn’t make the thing
no better, and that the more Ann Kerley kept herself to
herself the safer it would be for all parties.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the anguish of mind endured by the unwilling
sorceress defies description. Day by day her deplorable
plight became more evident to her. Now an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
indignant farmer’s wife would come to complain that
butter had not come, and on poor Ann’s protesting that
she had never so much as set foot near the dairy, would
retort that she had been seen gathering sticks at nightfall
in the pasture, and had doubtless bewitched the cows.
Now a village mother would hastily snatch up a child
when it toddled towards the witch’s house; even the
baker tossed the weekly loaf over the gate in fear, and
left his bill at Mrs. Clarke’s, saying he would call for the
money there. That lady informed her of the fact through
the closed door as she dumped her morning bucket of
water on the path without, adding that if she would like
to leave the money in the bucket when she put it ready
overnight, it would save trouble to every one.</p>

<p>Ann Kerley understood: even her old crony was now
afraid to meet her face to face.</p>

<p>As she realised this she fell to crying feebly and hopelessly,
as she had done so often of late, and Pussy came
and jumped upon her knee, rubbing herself against her,
and gazing at her with golden inscrutable eyes. The
warm contact of a living creature, even a cat, was comforting,
and the old woman hugged her favourite closely;
but presently, struck by a sudden thought, she pushed it
away, and turned aside her head.</p>

<p>“There! get down, love! do—get away with ’ee, else
I’ll maybe be doin’ thee a mischief. Oh dear, Puss, whatever
should I do if anything happened to thee?”</p>

<p>The idea positively appalled her, and from that moment
she was careful to avert her face when she set the cat’s
food before her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>Perhaps the greatest trial of all was the Sunday church-going.</p>

<p>“I d’ ’low the Lard won’t let I do nobody no harm in
His House,” she had said to herself at first, almost hopefully;
and she had donned her decent Sunday clothes
eagerly, not to say joyfully. She was by nature sociable,
and had suffered as severely from the inability to
indulge in an occasional chat, a little harmless gossip,
with this one and that one, as from a sense of being
under a ban.</p>

<p>So she had set forth cheerily, volunteering “A fine
marnin’, neighbours,” to the first group she had passed
upon the road. But dear, to be sure! how the folks had
jumped and squeezed themselves against the wall to let
her go by! She had not had the heart to greet the next
couple, staid elderly folk, who were pacing along in front
of her, full of Sabbath righteousness; but presently the
man had looked round, and had then nudged his wife,
and she had gathered up her skirts and scuttled on without
so much as a glance over her shoulder. Poor Ann
had fallen back and turned aside into a by-path until all
the congregation had streamed in, and then had crept up
the steps alone, and made her way to her place blindly,
for her eyes were full once more of piteous tears.</p>

<p>But even there humiliation awaited her, for she found
herself alone in her pew, none of its accustomed occupants
being willing to worship in such dangerous proximity.</p>

<p>“I must be a terr’ble wicked ’ooman, sure,” groaned
Ann to herself, and raised her poor smarting eyes to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
east window, whence the figure of the Good Shepherd
looked back at her, full of compassion and benignity.</p>

<p>But Ann quickly dropped her eyes again. Was He
not carrying a lamb upon His shoulder? It seemed to
her that even the painted innocent would droop and
falter beneath her gaze.</p>

<p>And so thenceforth she started for church long after
the other members of the congregation, and instead of
seeking her own place, stole humbly to a dark corner,
where, hidden away behind a pillar, she worshipped in
sorrow of heart.</p>

<p>Such a state of things could not have continued if the
old rector had been at home, but he was away holiday-making
in Switzerland, and the <i>locum tenens</i>, a young
curate from the neighbouring town, could not be expected
to notice a matter of the kind.</p>

<p>One Sunday afternoon it chanced that Farmer Joyce,
who lived up Riverton way, drove over to Little Branston,
and was good enough to give a lift to his neighbour,
Martha Hansford, Ann’s married daughter, who was
feeling, as she confessed, a bit anxious at not hearing
from her mother.</p>

<p>“There, she haven’t a-wrote since I can’t say when,”
she explained to the farmer, as the trap went spinning
along the road; “she don’t write herself, mother don’t,
but she do generally get somebody to drop me a line for
her, and I haven’t heard a word to-month; no, nor last
month either.”</p>

<p>“Rheumatics perhaps,” suggested the farmer.</p>

<p>“I’m sure I hope not, Mr. Joyce. My mother have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
never had sich a thing in her life, an’ ’tis to be hoped she
bain’t a-goin’ to begin now.”</p>

<p>“The wold lady’s busy, very like,” hazarded Mr. Joyce,
after ruminating a while. “The time do slip away so
quick, an’ one day do seem so like another, folks can’t
always be expected to put their minds to letter-writin’.”</p>

<p>“Lard love ’ee, sir,” returned Martha, startled into
familiarity, “farmer folks mid be busy enough, an’ lab’rin’
folks too—I can scarce find the day long enough to put in
all as I’ve a-got to do—but mother! what can a poor wold
body like mother have to work at, wi’out it’s a bit o’ knittin’,
or some such thing. No, it’s summat else, an’ I’m
sure I can’t think what it can be.”</p>

<p>Mr. Joyce was not imaginative enough to assist her by
any further hypothesis; therefore, he merely touched up
the horse and remarked reassuringly that they would soon
be there. And for the rest of the drive Martha devoted
herself to the somewhat difficult task of keeping her three-year-old
boy, Ally, from wriggling out of her arms.</p>

<p>Dropped at the bottom of the “dip” wherein was
situated Mrs. Kerley’s cottage, Martha hastened towards
it, Ally trotting gleefully beside her. Instead of finding
the cottage door open—as might have been expected this
sunny October afternoon—and catching a glimpse of her
mother’s quiet figure in its elbow-chair, she found the
house shut up, and apparently no sign of life about the
place. The very garden had a neglected look, or so it
seemed to her; and the little window, usually gay with
flowers, was blank and desolate, the check curtain within
being drawn across it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>“Mother!” cried Martha, in a tone of such anguish
that Ally immediately set up a corresponding wail. “Oh
mother, whatever is to do? Be you dead? Oh, mother!
be you dead?”</p>

<p>To her intense relief she heard the sound of a chair
being pushed back over the flagged floor within, and her
mother’s well-known step slowly cross the little kitchen.</p>

<p>“Martha! be it you, my dear?” But she did not open
the door, and when Martha eagerly tried the latch she
found that it did not yield.</p>

<p>“Mother, mother,” she cried in an agony of fear, “oh,
mother, what is it? Why don’t ye let I in?”</p>

<p>“I can’t, my dear,” came the tremulous voice from within.
“No, don’t ax it of I. I dursen’t, Martha! There, I mid
do ’ee a mischief.”</p>

<p>“Mother, what be talkin’ on?” Martha was beginning
incredulously, when her small son, impatient of the delay,
fairly drowned her voice with shrill clamour for admittance,
and vigorous kicking of his little hobnailed boots at the
panels of the door. Martha snatched him up and impatiently
clapped her hand over the protesting mouth.
In the momentary pause that ensued she heard her mother
weeping.</p>

<p>“Be that Ally? Oh, my blessed lamb! Oh, dear
heart! Oh, oh!” Then in a louder key came the
words broken by sobs: “Take en away, Martha, do—take
en away, lovey! Somethin’ bad might happen
else!”</p>

<p>Here Ally, wrenching himself free, burst into a roar of
indignation, and his mother, popping him down on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
ground, threw herself upon the door, and, exerting all
her strength, succeeded in bursting it open.</p>

<p>With a wail Ann shrank away from her into the farthest
corner of the room, hiding her face against the wall.</p>

<p>“Don’t ye come a-nigh me, Martha, don’t ye—don’t ye!
And take the blessed child away! Take him away this
minute!”</p>

<p>“I’ll do nothin’ o’ the kind,” returned Martha vehemently.
“Be you gone crazy, mother? Whatever is the
matter?”</p>

<p>“Nay, my dear, I bain’t gone crazy—it be worse, a
deal worse. I can’t tell however it did come about, Martha,
but, there, I be turned into a witch! I be evil-eyed, they
d’ say! There, ye’d never believe the terr’ble things
what have a-come about along o’ me jist lookin’.”</p>

<p>Martha dropped down in a chair and burst out laughing.
She was a hale, hearty young woman, who had had a bit
of schooling, and took a sane and cheerful view of life.</p>

<p>“God bless us, mother!” she cried, wiping her eyes at
last and springing up, “what put such a notion as that in
your head? You a witch! You hurtin’ things wi’ lookin’
at ’em! I never did hear such nonsense-talk in my life!”</p>

<p>“But it be true, Martha—it be true!” returned Ann,
still hiding her face in her trembling hands. “There, I’ve
seed it myself. Don’t you come too nigh, my dear, and
for mercy’s sake keep the darlin’ child away!”</p>

<p>“Nay, but I won’t,” retorted Martha; and, catching up
the child, she advanced with a determined air. “You
shall look at us—both of us—that you shall! Kiss
grandma, Ally, love—that’s it! Pull away her hands,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
and give her a big hug. There, the mischief’s done now,
if mischief there be. Bain’t he growed, grandma? Bain’t
he a fine boy? There, come an’ sit ye down and take en
on your knee and feel the weight of en.”</p>

<p>Ann could not withstand the spell of the little clinging
arms, the kisses rained upon her withered cheek. She
suffered the child to climb from his mother’s arms into
hers, and hugged him back passionately.</p>

<p>“Bless you, my lamb! Bless you, my darlin’ little
angel! Dear, but he be a fine boy, Martha. Bless you,
love! E-es; grandma ’ull find en a lump o’ sugar. Ah,
Martha, I be a-feared—it do seem a terr’ble risk; but,
there, I can’t think but what the Lard ’ull purtect the
innercent child.”</p>

<p>“Now, you come along, mother, and sit ye down, an’
don’t ye go so trembly. You’ll not hurt Ally; he be a
deal more like to hurt you, such a mischievous boy as he
be. Now, then, whoever has been frightenin’ of ye with
such talk?”</p>

<p>“My dear, they do all say it,” murmured Ann, looking
fearfully round.</p>

<p>Brokenly, and with many digressions, she told her tale.
Long before she had ended Martha was weeping too—weeping
with indignation and with a sense of despair; for,
argue as she might, she could not divest her mother of her
persuasion in her own fell powers. If Ann herself could
not be convinced of the folly of the supposition, what hope
could Martha have to do away with the unjust suspicions
of the neighbours?</p>

<p>Each fresh proof of the ostracism which had become<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
her mother’s portion added to her wrath and woe. She
had not had a bit of meat to her dinner, as was invariably
the case on Sunday, not having dared to venture forth to
buy it. There was not so much as a drop of milk in the
house, the child who usually brought it having declined to
perform that office. Ann had not liked even to go out
and get herself a few “spuds”—there were so many folks
about on Saturdays, she explained. There was no fire in
the grate, though the autumn day was sharp, for Farmer
Cosser had “dared” her to pick up any more sticks in his
field.</p>

<p>“I d’ ’low ye’d ha’ been dead afore long, if I hadn’t ha’
come,” cried Martha, and then fell a-sobbing again. What
was the use of her having come? What good could she
do?</p>

<p>The two women were sitting together in very melancholy
mood, when Farmer Joyce called to say that he
would hitch the horse at six o’clock, and Martha must
meet him at the top of the road.</p>

<p>“Hullo!” he cried, breaking off short at sight of their
tearful faces, “be you all a-cryin’ in here?”</p>

<p>And then Martha, eager for sympathy, made bold to
clutch at his stout arm and pour forth her tale. The
farmer, leaning against the door-post, listened at first in
amusement, afterwards with an indignation almost equal
to the daughter’s own.</p>

<p>“I never did hear such a thing!” he cried emphatically,
as she paused for breath. “They must be a pack o’ sammies
in this place—and wicked uns, too. Dear heart
alive! they’ve fair gallied the poor wold ’ooman out of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
her wits. Be there any one about? I’ll soon show ’em
what I think of ’em.”</p>

<p>“There’s a good few folks just goin’ their ways to
church,” cried Martha, eagerly pointing up the lane.</p>

<p>“Then I’ll step up and give ’em a bit o’ my mind,” returned
he. “You come along wi’ I, Mrs. Kerley—don’t
ye stop for to put on your bonnet—throw this ’ere ’ankercher
over your cap—else we’ll not be in time to catch ’em,
maybe.”</p>

<p>“No, I dursen’t do that,” protested Ann, plucking away
the handkerchief which he had thrown over her head;
“’twas that which did first start the notion. ’Twas a
windy day, d’ye see, an’ I was going to pick a bit o’ scroff,
an’ I just tied my handkercher round my head—an’ when
the bwoys did see I, they did pelt I wi’ stones and call I
witch.”</p>

<p>“Young rascals!” ejaculated the farmer, who had by
this time hauled her out of the house, and was hurrying
with her up the lane. “Come on, Martha! Make haste,
’ooman! There be a lot of ’em yonder.”</p>

<p>In a few moments he and the breathless women found
themselves in the midst of quite a little crowd, for Farmer
Joyce had waylaid the first group he came across, and the
sound of his stentorian tones, raised in wrathful accusation,
speedily summoned others.</p>

<p>“You be a wise lot here, you be!” he cried; “you do
know summat, you do. Tell ’ee what—you be the biggest
lot o’ stunpolls as ever was seed or heerd on. This be
your witch, be it?—thikky poor wold ’ooman what have
never done anybody a bit o’ harm in her life—poor wold<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
Ann Kerley what was born and bred here, and did get
married to a Little Branston man an’ all, and what have
lived among ye so quiet an’ peaceful as a body could do.
Why, look at her! Look at the poor wold frightened
face of her; d’ye mean for to tell I that’s the face of a
witch?”</p>

<p>“Well, she did blight our ’taters,” growled somebody.</p>

<p>“An’ she did overlook Mrs. Clarke’s young duck——”</p>

<p>“Did she?” retorted Farmer Joyce, sarcastically.
“Well, she didn’t overlook my young duck, and they be
dead—the most on ’em—what do ye make o’ that? Did
ye never hear, you wise folk, as duckling do mostly die
in thunder weather? And I’ll warrant you be too wise
hereabouts to have heerd that this be a blight-year. A
lot o’ my ’taters be blighted——”</p>

<p>“I’m sure,” put in poor Martha, eagerly, “our ’taters
be blighted too. There, my husband do say ’tis scarce
worth while to get ’em up.”</p>

<p>“I s’pose,” cried Farmer Joyce, looking round with
withering sarcasm, “I s’pose this ’ere witch have a-gone
and wished ill-luck to her own darter’s ’taters. ’Tis very
likely, I’m sure. And there’s another thing—I did hear
some tale o’ bees a-dyin’ arter they’d a-been put in a new
hive.”</p>

<p>“That’s true enough.” “’Tis true, sure,” came one or
two voices in reply, not with any great enthusiasm, however;
then a man’s sullen tones—“’Tis so true as anything.
They was my bees, an’ I can answer for ’t bein’ true.”</p>

<p>“How much food did ye put in for ’em when ye did
shift ’em?” inquired Joyce, fixing his eyes on the speaker.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>“How much food? I d’ ’low bees be like to keep
theirselves.”</p>

<p>“Not when you do take their store off ’em so late in
the season. You’ve a-killed your own bees, good man;
they were too weak, d’ye see, to keep wosses off when
they did come a-fightin’ of ’em. I’d ha’ thought you’d ha’
been clever enough to ha’ knowed that, seein’ what knowin’
folks you be in Little Branston. There, you did know
poor wold Mrs. Kerley tied her ’andkercher over her head
to make herself a witch—’twas that what made her a
witch, weren’t it? Now I be a witch, bain’t I?”</p>

<p>He whisked off his hat suddenly, and drawing a cotton
handkerchief from his pocket threw it over his head and
tied the ends beneath his chin. The sight of his large red
face with its fringe of grey whisker looking jubilantly out
of the red and yellow folds, was irresistibly comic; the
bystanders fairly roared. The farmer was quick to follow
up his advantage.</p>

<p>“I must be a witch,” he persisted, “seein’ as I’ve a-got
a witch’s head on;” then, seized by a yet more luminous
inspiration, he crowned the meek and trembling Ann
Kerley with his own broad-brimmed and shaggy beaver.</p>

<p>“Now, Mrs. Kerley be a farmer. She must be a farmer,
sure, for she be a-wearin’ a farmer’s hat. There be jist so
mich sense in the one notion as t’other. Here we be—Farmer
Kerley and Witch Joyce!”</p>

<p>The merriment at this point grew so uproarious that
the clergyman in his distant vestry very nearly sallied
forth to inquire the cause; but it died away as suddenly
as it had begun. The sight of poor old Ann’s lined face<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
looking patiently out from beneath its ridiculous headgear
was, on the whole, more pathetic than ludicrous; folks
began to look at each other, and to own to themselves
that they had been not only foolish, but cruel. Every
word that the farmer spoke had carried weight, and he
could have employed no more forcible argument than the
practical demonstration at the end. He was the very best
advocate who could have been chosen to plead for her—a
good plain man, like themselves, who thoroughly understood
the case. By the time Farmer Joyce had resumed
his hat and restored his handkerchief to his pocket, the
cause was won. People had gathered round Ann with
rough apologies and kindly handshakes, and she was
escorted homewards by more than one long-estranged
friend.</p>

<p>When little Ally, who had been asleep on the settle,
woke at the sound of the approaching voices, and came
trotting out of the banned house, rubbing his eyes and
calling loudly for “Grandma,” the good women nodded
to each other meaningly, and said that he was a fine boy,
bless him, and he wouldn’t be likely to look so well if—— And
then somebody sniffed the air, and observed
that he shouldn’t wonder but what Mrs. Kerley’s ’taters was
a bit blighted too, and Mrs. Kerley replied that she was
sure they mid be, but she didn’t know, for she hadn’t had
the heart to look. And then the expert returned authoritatively
that he was quite sure they was done for, which
seemed wonderfully satisfactory to all parties.</p>

<p>And then Farmer Joyce bethought him that it was time
to hitch the horse, and the rest of Ann’s friends remembered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
that “last bell” would soon ha’ done ringing; so
gradually the little crowd melted away, and Martha embraced
her mother with a thankful heart, and went away
likewise, leaving Ally behind, according to the farmer’s
advice, who had reminded her in a gruff whisper that the
little chap would be more like to take off the wold body’s
mind from that there queer notion nor anything else.</p>

<p>So the little house, which had been so desolate a few
hours before, was now restored to homely joy and peace;
and when Martha looked back from the summit of the
lane, she saw her mother standing, all smiles, in the open
doorway, shading her eyes from the sun, which was making
a glory round the curly head of the child in her arms.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">A RUNAWAY COUPLE.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Summer</span> dawn; a thousand delicate tints in the sky above
and dewy world beneath; birds stretching drowsy little
wings and piping to each other; dumb things waking up
one by one and sending forth their several calls. But as
yet nothing seemed astir in the old house; the windows,
open for the most part, were still curtained; no thin spiral
of smoke wound its way upwards from the kitchen chimney.
Ruddy shafts of light made cheer, indeed, on the mullioned
panes and the moss-grown coping, picked out the stone-crops
and saxifrages on the roof, ran along the stone
gutter, bathed the old chimney stacks with a glow that
would seem to mock at the empty hearths within.</p>

<p>Presently a great clucking and crowing was heard from
the poultry-yard at the rear of the house, and a moment
or two after a little old lady came trotting along the mossy
path behind the yew hedge and picked her way daintily
between the apple-trees in the orchard. As she proceeded
she looked to right and to left as though in fear, yet her
face was wreathed in the broadest of smiles, and every now
and then she uttered an ecstatic chuckle. Now out at the
wicket-gate and down the lane to the right. Lo! standing
outlined against the purple expanse of moor a hundred
paces or so from the gate an equipage was drawn up; two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
men were stationed by the horses’ heads, one of whom
hurried forward to meet her, while the other stiffly climbed
up on the box. The first, a tall burly old man, wearing a
white top-hat, an old-fashioned embroidered waistcoat,
and a spick-and-span suit of broadcloth, beckoned eagerly
as he hastened towards her, while the figure on the box
waved his whip, and jerked his elbow with every sign of
impatience.</p>

<p>“So there ye be at last, my dear!” cried the old gentleman.
“Blest if I didn’t think they’d catched ye. Come
along, hurry up! Let’s be off; it’s close upon four o’clock.”</p>

<p>The lady, who was plump and somewhat short of breath,
merely chuckled again by way of rejoinder, and suffered
herself to be hoisted into the waiting chaise. It was an
extremely old-fashioned chaise with a hood and a rumble;
the coachman was equally antiquated in appearance, and
wore a moth-eaten livery of obsolete cut and a beaver
hat.</p>

<p>“Now off with ye, Jem,” cried the old gentleman in a
stage whisper. “Let ’em go, my lad. Don’t spare the
cattle! We must be miles away from here before the
folks yonder have time to miss us. But whatever did
keep ye so long, Susan?” he inquired, turning to the lady.</p>

<p>“My dear,” said she, with a delighted giggle, “I’ve been
to feed the chickens.”</p>

<p>Thereupon her companion fell into a paroxysm of suppressed
merriment, growing purple in the face, and slapping
his thigh in ecstacy. The old coachman turned round
upon the box and bent down his ear to catch the joke.</p>

<p>“Missus has been to feed chicken, Jem,” laughed his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
master. “Ho! ho! ho!—she wouldn’t leave out that part,
ye may be sure.”</p>

<p>Jem grinned. “No, I d’ ’low she wouldn’t. Missus be
a grand hand at feedin’ chicken; she’ve a-had prac<i>tise</i>,
haven’t she, Measter? I’ll go warrant she have.”</p>

<p>“And I’ve been doing something else too, John,” continued
she, when the explosion had in some measure
subsided. “See here!”</p>

<p>She opened the lid of the little covered basket which
she carried, and displayed three nosegays of white flowers.</p>

<p>“I thought we might wear these,” she remarked. “I
very nearly brought favours for the horses, too, but I was
afraid it would excite remark.”</p>

<p>“And you were right,” said he; “but I think we’ve
managed pretty well to put ’em off the scent. Jem did
drive a good bit along the Dorchester road, and back very
quiet over the heath. ’Twas very artful of ’ee, my dear,
to be talkin’ so innercent-like about Weymouth yesterday—they’ll
think we’ve a-gone there, for sure.”</p>

<p>The old lady drew herself up with a little conscious air.</p>

<p>“It takes a woman’s wit to think of them things,” she
said: “But I do feel sorry for them all, too. I left just a
bit of a line for Mary to say she wasn’t to be frightened and
we was just gone for the day, and they mustn’t think of
looking for us. But I can’t help thinking it does seem a
shame. There, all the poor things will be comin’ from
this place and that place and bringing the children, and
making ready their little speeches, and getting out their
little presents——”</p>

<p>The old man began to chuckle again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>She looked at him reproachfully, and he laughed louder
and rubbed his hands.</p>

<p>“’Tis very unfeeling of you to laugh like that, John.
I’m sure it is. Haven’t you got no feeling for your own
flesh and blood?”</p>

<p>“If you come to that,” said John, “whose notion was
it? Says I, ‘I do wish,’ I says, ‘we could give ’em all the
slip and spend the happy day quiet by our two selves.’
And says you, ‘Why shouldn’t we, then?’ says you.
‘Look here,’ you says, ‘why shouldn’t we do it over
again, John?’ ‘What?’ says I. ‘What we done fifty
years ago,’ says you. ‘Well,’ I says, and I say now, ‘it
takes a woman’s cleverness to think o’ such things.’ So
here we be a-runnin’ away again, love; bain’t we?”</p>

<p>She extended her little mittened hand to him with a
gracious smile that had in it a droll assumption of coyness.</p>

<p>“There’s the ring, though,” said he; “that there ring
ought to come off, Susan, else it ’ull not seem real-like.”</p>

<p>His gnarled old fingers were already fumbling with the
ring, but she jerked away her hand quickly.</p>

<p>“No, indeed!” she cried. “Have it off! I wouldn’t
have it off for a thousand pounds. It’s never been off my
finger all these years, John, and I’m certainly not going to
have it off to-day.”</p>

<p>She pinned the nosegay in his coat, assumed a similar
decoration herself, and handed one to Jem. Then they
drove onwards with renewed speed. Jem, following his
master’s advice, was not sparing the cattle; the old chaise
rocked from side to side, the horses flew along the road.
They had now left the heath behind and found themselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
on the highway; the country was looking its best this fine
sunny morning; the hedges were still white with bloom;
the leafage of the woods through which they passed was
yet untarnished by heat or dust; a spicy fragrance was
wafted towards them from the fir plantations; in the
villages the folks were beginning to stir; chimneys were
smoking; women moving to and fro, here and there a
man sauntering fieldwards.</p>

<p>They looked after the rattling chaise with astonishment.</p>

<p>“I hope nobody will set up a hue and cry,” ejaculated
the old lady nervously. “There’s nobody coming after
us, is there, Jem?”</p>

<p>“Don’t ye be afeared, mum,” returned Jem valiantly.
“You sit still, Mrs. Bussell; nobody’s thinkin’ o’ sich a
thing, an’ if they was, we’d soon leave ’em behind. I
brought ye safe to Branston this day fifty year ago, an’
I’ll do the same to-day, dalled if I don’t.”</p>

<p>“So ye did, Jem, so ye did,” exclaimed his master.
“Dear heart alive, do ye mind, Sukey, that time we heard
such a clatterin’ behind us, and you thought all was lost,
and Jem turned right into Yellowham Wood. How he
done it I can never think. But we crope out of sight and
the folks rattled past. And ’twasn’t nobody thinkin’ of us
at all. ’Twas young Squire Frampton drivin’ for a wager.”</p>

<p>“Yes, my father was looking for us along the Dorchester
road,” said she, laughing again.</p>

<p>“He! he!” chimed in Jem, “I mind that well. ’Twas
my cousin Joe what took yon empty shay. He couldn’t
for the life of en make out why he were to ride so fast
wi’ nobody inside. ‘Never you mind, Joe,’ says I, ‘ride<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
away for your gold piece,’ I says. I weren’t a-goin’ to tell
he what was a-goin’ on. He weren’t to be trusted same as
me. He understood about the gold piece right enough,
and, dally! he did understand Squire Sherren’s horsewhip,
too, when he comed up wi’ en and couldn’t make Joe tell
en where he was gone. I d’ ’low ye was half-way to Lunnon
by that time.”</p>

<p>“Poor Joe!” said Mrs. Bussell compassionately.</p>

<p>“Pooh!” exclaimed bluff old John, “a gold piece would
mend many broken bones. Well, my dear, I’m gettin’
sharp-set, what do ye say to a bit of breakfast? Pull up
at the first sheltered place you come to, Jem.”</p>

<p>“But let it be somewhere where you can keep a look-out,”
put in the old lady anxiously. “Don’t let’s be
caught.”</p>

<p>By-and-by they arrived at a suitable place, and Jem
duly pulled up, and John brought out a well-packed hamper
from the rumble, and Mrs. Bussell made tea from a
spirit-lamp, and dispensed goodly portions of buttered roll,
and ham, and hard-boiled eggs, and John and Jem took
turns to act sentry, and little Mrs. Bussell raised an alarm
about every five minutes and entered more and more into
the spirit of the enterprise. Her husband, setting his
white hat rakishly on the back of his head, and looking
extremely jocose, endeavoured to throw himself into the
part which he had played a half-century before, but did
not altogether succeed in representing the trembling young
lover, even though he called the old lady by her maiden
name, and delivered himself of sundry amorous speeches
with a fervour that was occasionally mixed with hilarity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>“Faith, my dear,” he cried when she took him to
task, “you must let me talk as I please. I was your
lover then, and I am your lover now, for all we’ve been
man and wife this fifty years. What signifies it whether
your hair is gold or silver, or whether you are fat or slim?
Handsome is as handsome does, I say, and you’ve a-been
the best wife a man could have.”</p>

<p>“La! John,” said she, and winked away a tear. John
put out his rugged old hand and gripped hers.</p>

<p>“The best wife a man could have,” he repeated earnestly.
“Fifty years!—I wish we mid have fifty years more together.”</p>

<p>“I wish we was back at the beginning,” said she. “I’d
like to go through it all over again, John. I’d take it all
and be thankful—the rough and the smooth, and the joy and
the sorrow. Except maybe—poor little Ben, you know—I
don’t think I’d like to live through those years again.
How we hoped, didn’t we? And he was took at the last.”</p>

<p>“Well, ye have the other seven, Susan, my dear, alive
and well, and their children. Why, you mid say that one
loss has been made up to ye by more than a score of other
blessings.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bussell shook her head, but smiled, and presently
wondered aloud if John’s Annie would bring the baby.</p>

<p>“I’d like to have seen it, too,” she added. “I hope
Mary will have the sense to keep them. I told her a good
many of them would stop the night.”</p>

<p>“Somebody’s coming!” announced Jem at this juncture.</p>

<p>And then what a bustle and clatter ensued, what hasty
packing of the hamper, what tremulous climbing into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
chaise on the part of the “missus”; with what an air of
firmness and resolution did the master straighten his hat
and square his shoulders as though preparing to defy all
pursuers. And after all it was only the mail cart bowling
merrily along; and the driver gave the runaway couple
a cheery good-day as he passed. Then, though they
laughed long and loud over the false alarm, they realised
that the time was getting on, and that it behoved them to
hasten to their destination.</p>

<p>The little town of Branston was not yet very wide-awake
when they did arrive at the Royal George, and
Jem pulled up with a flourish, and threw the reins to a
gaping stable-boy with as great an air as would have
befitted a coachman in the palmy days when the Flying
Stage used to change horses at Branston. The little old
lady alighted demurely, her husband supporting her while
she planted first one neat little foot, clad in a buckled
shoe and clocked white stocking, on the step, and then its
fellow, and lifting her off bodily, with much the same
tender gallantry as that with which he had doubtless performed
a similar office fifty years ago. At his request,
Mrs. Bussell was conducted to the best private room; she
seemed to have quite identified herself with those bygone
days, and clung to his arm fearfully as they mounted the
stairs; while in her husband past and present were
pleasantly mingled. Thus, when, having deposited his
fair charge in the George’s largest sitting-room, he strolled
down to the lower premises to give certain orders regarding
the horses, he made no ado about taking the landlord
into his confidence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>“This ’ere is a runaway trip,” he remarked, with a
jocular wink. “’Tis our golden weddin’ day, and the
missus and me had a notion o’ spendin’ it quiet, just by
our two selves. They’re makin’ a great to-do at our place—children
and grandchildren comin’ from all sides, but
we just thought we’d give them the slip, and keep the day
here same as we done fifty year ago.”</p>

<p>“Ah,” put in the landlord, much interested, “I heard
somethin’ about that. You and your lady run off, didn’t
ye?”</p>

<p>“We did,” returned John. “Her father, ye see, old
Sherren—they did use to call en Squire—she was the
only child, and he reckoned on her makin’ a grand match,
takin’ up wi’ one o’ the reg’lar gentry, ye know; but he
wasn’t a bit better nor the rest of any of us yeoman farmers.
Well, I wasn’t much of a match in those days—my
father had a long family and not much to divide
between us; but I liked the maid, and the maid she did
like me, so we took the law into our own hands. My
missus, she did use to go a-feedin’ of her chicken very
early in the mornin’, so the folks got accustomed to hearin’
her get up and go out before daylight almost—and one
mornin’ she did go out and she didn’t never go back.”</p>

<p>“I remember,” cried the other, “you tricked them wi’ an
empty post-chaise, didn’t ye?”</p>

<p>“To be sure,” returned the old farmer chuckling.
“’Twas Joe Boyt did that. He did ride for all he were
worth, the wrong way. And me and the maid ran a
couple of mile on our own legs, till we come to the high
road where Jem was awaitin’ for us wi’ the very same old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
shay as we did drive over in to-day. I did swear I’d buy
it if ever I had the chance, and I’d take Jem into my
service. And I did both.”</p>

<p>“The old Squire came round before long,” remarked
the landlord; “yes, I heard the tale often enough.
There’s an old chap here as used to be ostler in the old
days, and he minds well how you and the lady came here
to hide, so to speak, till the coach came up.”</p>

<p>“That’s it!” cried old John delightedly, slapping his
thigh to give emphasis to his words. “The coach took us
to Bath and we had the job done there—licence, you
know. And the missus and I, d’ye see, had the notion
o’ stoppin’ here to-day in memory of that time, and makin’
believe we was doin’ it over again. Between you and me,”
said John, poking the landlord in the waistcoat and winking
knowingly, “I d’ ’low my old woman does truly believe
she is back in the old times again. Women do seem to
have a wonderful power of imagination. There, she was
a-feedin’ her chicken this mornin’, if ye please, just as she
done the mornin’ we made off.”</p>

<p>“Well, well,” commented the landlord. “You ought
to let old ’Neas Bright have a look at ye both. He’s up
in the almhouse now, poor old chap, through not bein’
able to work any more, but he’d hobble down if he was to
know ye were here.”</p>

<p>“Send for en, then, send for en,” cried John eagerly;
“but look ye, landlord—keep the secret. Don’t ye let
the folks know who we are or what we’ve come for, else
maybe the children ’ull catch as yet.”</p>

<p>The landlord laughed and promised, and thereupon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
John went back to his lady, whom he found peeping cautiously
out at the Market Place from behind the window
curtain.</p>

<p>“Did you think about ordering dinner?” inquired she.</p>

<p>“No, my dear, I left that to you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, John,” she cried bashfully, “I feel nervous-like. I
don’t want to ring the bell and have folks starin’ at me.
Go down again and order it—at twelve sharp.”</p>

<p>“What shall we have?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“There now—to ask such a thing. Why, the same as
we had this day fifty year ago, of course.”</p>

<p>“And what was that?” asked he.</p>

<p>“Why, John, I never thought you would forget anything
about that day. We had a beefsteak-pudding and a boiled
fowl with parsley-and-butter sauce, and potatoes in their
jackets, and greens.”</p>

<p>“So we had,” said John.</p>

<p>“And you had cheese and a crusty loaf, and I had a bit
o’ rice puddin’. And you had a tankard o’ best October
ale, and I had a glass of sherry wine. Don’t you remember,
John, you would make me take the wine though I
wasn’t used to it and was afraid it might go to my head?”</p>

<p>“Yes, to be sure,” returned he. “Well, I’ll go and order
all that.”</p>

<p>“And then come back to me—come straight back to
me, John. Don’t stay gossiping downstairs. I feel quite
nervous.”</p>

<p>“Do you think this was the room we had?” inquired
John, pausing half-way to the door. “It don’t look the
same somehow.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>“They’ve spoilt it with this new-fangled furniture,” returned
she; “but it is the same. I remember this little
window at the end looking towards the Market Place.
Oh, John—see here.”</p>

<p>“What is that, my dear?”</p>

<p>“Why, look here at the corner of the pane. Here are
our very name letters, S for Susan, and J for John, and the
true-lovers’-knot on the top. I remember your scratching
’em quite well.”</p>

<p>“Why, so I did,” cried he. “I’d a glass-cutter in my
big knife. Well, to be sure! There they are—and here
we are!”</p>

<p>“Here we are,” echoed she. “Thanks be to God for
all His mercies.”</p>

<p>And thereupon she clasped both her little wrinkled
hands round his arm and gave it a tender squeeze, and he
stooped down and kissed her round, wholesome, pink old
cheek.</p>

<p>Well, after John had ordered the dinner, and after old
’Neas Bright had come limping down from the almshouse
and had related divers anecdotes, and drunk the couple’s
health, and gone away rejoicing with a half-crown piece in
his pocket, John and Susan sat down behind the screen
which cut off one corner of the room from the rest, and
gave themselves up to repose and reminiscence.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was because they were so happy and so much
absorbed in each other, and also perhaps because they had
both of them grown a trifle hard of hearing of late years,
that they did not notice a sudden bustle and excitement
in the street below.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>Had they looked out they would have seen a string of
vehicles of different kinds drawn up just outside—spring-carts,
gigs, a waggonette, and last but not least, a waggon
drawn by a team of splendid farm-horses and filled to
overflowing with country people. All the occupants of
these conveyances were dressed in holiday attire, all wore
enormous white nosegays, while the horses’ blinkers and the
drivers’ whips were alike decorated with snowy streamers.
The door opened suddenly, and some one ran round the
screen.</p>

<p>“Why, there they are!” cried a child’s jubilant voice.
“There’s grandpa and grandma a-sittin’ hand-in-hand.”</p>

<p>And then from the staircase, and from the hall, and
from the street arose a sudden deafening cheer.</p>

<p>“I d’ ’low they’ve caught us!” cried John, with a whimsical
glance at his spouse; but she was already engaged
in fondling the child and scarcely heard him.</p>

<p>A moment afterwards the room was crowded with the
descendants of the old folks—three generations of them:
middle-aged prosperous-looking sons and daughters; rosy
grandchildren and even one great-grandchild, for young
John’s Annie <i>had</i> brought her baby, which proved to be
the finest child of its age that had ever been seen, and to
have “come on wonderful” since Mrs. Bussell last beheld
it. And there was such a kissing and hugging and scolding
and laughing as had surely never before been heard in
that staid, respectable old room, and grandma was very
arch and coy on being reproached for her unkind notion,
and grandpa chuckled boisterously, and rubbed his hands,
and Mary, the only unmarried daughter, related how her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
suspicions had at first been aroused on discovering that the
chickens had been fed so early—all the family knowing
the history of that bygone ruse by heart; and how, though
she <i>did</i> at first fancy they might have gone to Weymouth,
she had made inquiries in the neighbourhood, and had
ascertained that a chaise with three people wearing white
nosegays had been seen driving Branston-way very soon
after daylight. And then John, the eldest son, took up
the tale, and related how they had settled to wait till all
the family had arrived, and how he had declared that the
labourers and their wives should not be baulked of their
share of merry-making, and how the whole party was come
to keep the golden wedding at Branston.</p>

<p>“The folks are waiting for you outside now,” he concluded;
“you’d best show yourselves to them, else they’ll
never forgive you.”</p>

<p>So over to the window marched the bridal couple, and
there they stood arm-in-arm, the illusion being a little
damaged by the presence of the baby which grandma
would not relinquish, and by the background of laughing
folk, all of whom bore so strong a family likeness to their
progenitors that their relationship could not be doubted.</p>

<p>A rousing cheer went up once more, and John waved
his hat in reply, and Susan laughed and nodded, and was
suddenly taken by surprise by a dimness in the eyes and a
choking sensation in the throat.</p>

<p>“I don’t know however I could have had the heart to
run away from them,” she murmured.</p>

<p>And then when the speeches had been made, and the
presents delivered, and the wedding-feast, supplemented<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
by many substantial additions, set forth upon the table,
and when she sat down with John the elder on her right
and John the younger on her left, and Annie’s baby sound
asleep in her lap, and looked round at the kindly happy
faces, she surreptitiously squeezed her husband’s hand:—</p>

<p>“You and me was very happy this time fifty year,” she
said, “but after all—I don’t know—I d’ ’low this is best.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">POSTMAN CHRIS.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was about four o’clock of the afternoon when Postman
Chris set forth on his second round. He swung along at
a rapid pace, looking about him with the pleased, alert air
of one for whom his surroundings had not yet lost the
charm of novelty.</p>

<p>He had, indeed, that very morning entered on his duties
as postman for the first time, though he had served his
country in another way before. For Postman Chris Ryves
had been Trooper Chris Ryves in a previous state of existence.
He had had his fill of warfare in South Africa,
and had indeed been wounded at Graspan; the left breast
of his brand-new blue uniform was decorated with a medal
and quite a row of clasps. Though Postman Chris walked
at ease he held himself with the erectness due to military
training, and his straw hat was perched at the rakish angle
which in earlier days, when he had paraded at Knightsbridge
Barracks, had caused the heart of more than one
artless city maiden to flutter in her bosom.</p>

<p>But for all these past glories of his, Postman Chris was
an eminently pleasant and affable person; at any chance
salutation of a passer-by the white teeth would flash out
in that brown, brown face of his with the most good-humoured
of smiles; he delivered up his letters with an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
urbanity of demeanour that was only surpassed by his
soldierly promptitude, and he was willing to exchange the
news of the day with any pedestrian who cared to march
a short distance in his company.</p>

<p>The bag which he carried was not unduly heavy, nor
his way fatiguingly long; it was a six-mile round in fact—starting
from Chudbury-Marshall, proceeding through
Riverton and Little Branston to the market town of
Branston and so back again.</p>

<p>It chanced that as Chris approached Little Branston
Schoolhouse on this particular day, his attention was
attracted by a hubbub of voices and laughter proceeding
from the adjoining field. Pausing a moment in his rapid
progress he looked through a gap in the hedge. A feast
was evidently in progress; some of the children still sat in
rows on the grass, armed with great cups of sickly-looking
tea and munching vigorously, buns or hunches of bread-and-jam;
others, having finished their meal, were already
at play.</p>

<p>Here “Blind-man’s-buff” was going on, there “Drop
Handkerchief”. In the corner of the field directly under
the postman’s observation a game of Forfeits was proceeding.
The schoolmistress, who sat facing him, was holding
up one object after the other over the blindfolded head of
a pupil-teacher, a bright little girl who had left school recently
enough to enter still with almost childish zest into
such amusements.</p>

<p>“Here’s a Fine Thing and a very Fine Thing; what is the
owner of this Fine Thing to do?” cried the schoolmistress.
She had a pleasant, clear voice, and though she sat back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
upon her heels like many of her pupils, there was something
particularly graceful about figure and attitude.</p>

<p>“That’s a shapely maid,” remarked Postman Chris to
himself; “yes, and a vitty one too.”</p>

<p>It will be seen that Chris Ryves was a Dorset man, as
indeed his name betokened; he came in fact from the
other side of the county.</p>

<p>The face which he looked on was as pretty as the
figure, its fresh bloom enhanced by the darkness of eyes
and hair.</p>

<p>“What is the owner of this Fine Thing to do?” she
repeated.</p>

<p>“She must bite an inch off a stick,” responded the pupil-teacher,
with a delighted giggle.</p>

<p>The owner of the forfeit, a peculiarly stolid-looking
child, came slowly up to redeem her pledge, and, after a
mystified but determined attempt to obey the mandate
literally, was duly initiated into the proper and innocuous
manner of accomplishing it. Then the performance was
resumed.</p>

<p>“Here’s a Fine Thing and a very Fine Thing; and what
must the owner of this very Fine Thing do?” chanted the
schoolmistress.</p>

<p>“Is it a boy or a girl?” asked the blindfolded oracle.</p>

<p>“Boy,” responded the schoolmistress.</p>

<p>“Then he must bow to the wittiest, kneel to the prettiest,
and kiss the one he loves best.”</p>

<p>A little round-faced urchin came forward to claim his
cap, and, after much prompting and not a little pushing,
was induced to carry out the prescribed programme.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>He duly pulled a forelock to the pupil-teacher, bent his
knee to a small person with a necklace and a profusion of
corkscrew ringlets, and bestowed a careless salute on the
chubby cheek of a smaller and still more round-faced
female edition of himself—evidently a sister.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m dalled!” said the postman. “Them children
ha’n’t got no eyes in their heads.”</p>

<p>And with that he stepped back from the hedge, hitched
up his bag a little higher on his shoulder, and strode off
towards Branston.</p>

<p>The next day at the same hour Ruby Damory, the
schoolmistress, was standing on the threshold of the
schoolhouse with a copybook in her hand. She sometimes
lingered after school had broken up and the pupil-teacher
had made things tidy and betaken herself homewards,
to look over the children’s exercises before returning
to her lodgings; and as the interior of the house was close
and stuffy she preferred to accomplish this task in the
porch. The school-yard was as dusty and bleak as such
places usually are; but by some strange chance the rose-tree
which was trained over the porch remained uninjured
by the constant passing of little feet and contact of little
persons. It grew luxuriantly, and its clustering blossoms
formed a pretty setting to the slim figure which stood
propped against the wall beneath.</p>

<p>All at once Ruby raised her eyes from her book; a
rapid step was advancing along the footpath from the
direction of Riverton; over the irregular line of hedge she
could see a straw hat set at a knowing angle on a head of
bright red hair. It was the new postman from Chudbury—she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
had seen him go past that morning before she had
yet left her room.</p>

<p>Now he was opposite the schoolhouse gate, but instead
of passing it he stood still, wheeled about with military
precision, and took off his hat with a flourish.</p>

<p>“I bow to the wittiest,” said Postman Chris.</p>

<p>Then, before she had time either to respond or to turn
away, he was marching on again, and soon disappeared
behind the tall hedge on the other side of the school
precincts.</p>

<p>“Well, to be sure!” said Ruby, and she laughed to herself;
“he must have noticed our game yesterday. He
was very complimentary, I must say, though I don’t quite
know how he could find out I was witty. I suppose he
thinks I must be because I’m the schoolmistress.”</p>

<p>And thereupon she returned to the exercise.</p>

<p>But in spite of herself her thoughts kept wandering to
Postman Chris and his odd proceedings, and she said to
herself that, though his hair was red it was not at all an
ugly colour—in fact when he took off his hat it flashed in
the sun like burnished copper. The phrase took her fancy
for she liked a fine word or two when opportunity offered;
and she was pleased too with the aptness of the simile, for
she possessed a little copper tea-kettle which she only used
on great occasions, and which was, she fancied, precisely
the colour of the new postman’s hair in the sunshine. He
had a nice smile, too, and such quick, bright, brown eyes.
And then that medal, and those clasps and orders—decidedly
Postman Chris appeared to the schoolmistress
somewhat in the light of a hero.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>All the evening she thought of his brown face and his
pleasant voice, and of how his hair had flashed in the sun.
On going home she got down the copper tea-kettle and
looked at it, turning it about in the lamplight—yes, it
really recalled the glow of the new postman’s hair.</p>

<p>When, on the next day, Ruby heard the regular and
rapid steps approaching, she stood for a moment in doubt;
should she go indoors, or should she give the man a civil
good-day as he passed.</p>

<p>She chose the latter alternative, but as she opened her
lips to speak the words died on them, for Postman Chris,
once more pausing in front of the gate, dropped on his
knees and bowed his head. Their eyes met as he raised
it again, and he said emphatically: “I kneel to the
prettiest.”</p>

<p>Then, springing to his feet, he was gone before Ruby
had time to recover from her astonishment. She went
inside the larger schoolroom and sat down on the nearest
bench, trembling from head to foot.</p>

<p>What did the man mean? Was he laughing at her?
No, the brown eyes had looked into hers with as earnest
and straightforward a gaze as was to be found in the eyes
of man. Was he courting her then? It looked like it,
but what a strange way to set about it. No preliminaries—no
permission asked—not even a question exchanged
between them. Did he intend to carry out the third part
of the programme with the same speed and decision with
which he had set about fulfilling the first two?</p>

<p>Ruby blushed hotly to herself, and then tossed her head.
She was not to be won without due wooing, and after all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
was she, in any event, to be won by this man? She knew
nothing of him except that he was a reservist with a small
pension, and that he was a postman—a village postman.
Was it likely that a girl of her education and position
would throw herself away on a fellow like that—even if he
had a kindly face, and a nice way of looking at one, and
hair the colour of a copper tea-kettle? Besides, he should
know better than to approach her with so light a spirit.</p>

<p>The next day when Postman Chris came swinging along
the Branston road the schoolhouse porch was empty, the
door bolted and barred. For a full moment he stood
gazing towards it, and Ruby, peering cautiously out at
him from behind the sheltering blackboard, saw his expression
change from the eager tenderness which had for
the fraction of a second almost made her wish that she
were indeed standing in the porch, to one of hurt and
proud surprise.</p>

<p>He wheeled about without delay, and the sound of his
steps fell like a knell upon her heart.</p>

<p>Acting upon an unaccountable impulse she flung open
the door and darted to the gate, but Postman Chris never
turned his head.</p>

<p>On the next day she again watched from behind the
blackboard, and saw the postman march past, without so
much as a glance either to right or to left. On the day
after, strange to relate, Miss Ruby Damory, the schoolmistress,
happened to be correcting exercises in the porch
when the postman from Chudbury-Marshall walked by;
but Postman Chris never caught sight of the schoolmistress.
He was whistling as he walked, and held a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
little cane in his hand with which he switched at the
hedge. When he passed the school-gate he tapped it
with his cane, and subsequently drew it along the railings
which bordered the yard; but he never turned his head.</p>

<p>There was no afternoon post on Sunday, but Postman
Chris was at Evening Church, and there Ruby saw him
with the light of the stained-glass window falling on his
uncovered head and making a very nimbus of his hair.</p>

<p>When Monday afternoon came she was standing, not in
the school-porch but at the gate, and when Postman Chris
drew near she accosted him in a small voice which did
not sound like hers. Indeed, she felt at the time as though
it were not she herself who was thus laying aside maidenly
dignity, but some wicked little spirit within her, who acted
for her against her will.</p>

<p>“Good-day, postman,” said Ruby, or the demon within
her.</p>

<p>Postman Chris brought his heels together and saluted—not
having yet learnt to lay aside this habit—but his face
wore an expression of surprise.</p>

<p>“Have you got a letter for me, to-day?” went on the
voice.</p>

<p>“Name?” said Chris succinctly.</p>

<p>“Miss Ruby Damory,” came the hurried answer.</p>

<p>The postman shook his head.</p>

<p>“I’m expecting a letter,” went on Ruby confusedly.
“Perhaps you may have left one at my lodgings in Little
Branston? I live at Mrs. Maidment’s at the corner of
Green Lane.”</p>

<p>The postman looked at her with an expression which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
would seem to indicate that Ruby’s place of abode was a
matter of supreme indifference to him.</p>

<p>“If any letter comes as is directed there, of course it
will be left there,” he said, with a coldly business-like air.</p>

<p>“You didn’t leave one for me, to-day, I suppose?”
faltered Ruby.</p>

<p>“Not as I know on,” returned Chris stolidly.</p>

<p>Tears rushed to the girl’s eyes; she felt wounded,
insulted by this sudden change from warm admiration—admiration
which possibly might have ripened to something
else—to complete indifference. She hastily turned
away her head to conceal them, but not before she had
caught sight of a kind of gleam in the postman’s brown
eyes.</p>

<p>“Are ye so terrible disappointed?” he inquired roughly,
not to say harshly.</p>

<p>“I—oh, yes, of course I am.”</p>

<p>She spoke truly enough, poor girl, though her disappointment
arose from another cause than the ostensible
one.</p>

<p>Chris eyed her sharply.</p>

<p>“Well, it’ll come in time, I suppose!” he remarked, still
in the same surly tone, “and when it <i>do</i> come, you shall
have it.”</p>

<p>And thereupon he saluted, hitched up his bag, and
walked away.</p>

<p>Ruby went back to the school-porch, with a scarlet face
and a mist before her eyes:—</p>

<p>“He’s a rude fellow,” she said; “I’ll think of him no
more.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>But she was in a manner forced to think of him.</p>

<p>It was an unkind Fate, indeed, which decreed that Postman
Chris Ryves’ beat should bring him under Ruby
Damory’s notice twice in the day. Early in the morning,
while still in her little lodging at the corner of Green Lane,
she heard his brisk step ring out beneath her window, and
looking down, as indeed she sometimes did from beneath
the corner of her blind, she caught a glimpse of a blue
uniform and a red head; but Postman Chris never looked
up, and no letter was ever left for Miss Ruby Damory,
care of Mrs. Maidment.</p>

<p>Then as the church clock struck half-past four a tall
figure was always to be seen swinging along behind the
green hedge, which drew near the school-gate, and passed
by the school-yard without a single glance at the mistress
correcting exercises in the porch.</p>

<p>It was out of pure contradictoriness of course that Ruby
Damory learned to listen for that step and to watch for
that figure. She grew thin and pale, slept brokenly, and
dreamt frequently about Postman Chris; and Mrs. Maidment
averred almost with tears that Miss Damory seemed
to have no relish for her victuals, and could indeed be
scarce persuaded to eat a radish with her tea.</p>

<p>One day the girl took herself seriously to task. “I am
a fool and worse,” she said. “I must make an end of it.
The man does not care a snap of his fingers for me—I’ll
try to forget he’s in the world.”</p>

<p>Therefore she refrained from peeping out from behind
her blind on the following morning, and, in the afternoon,
she locked up the schoolhouse directly the children had left,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
and proceeded homewards with the exercise-books under
her arm. But whether because Postman Chris was more
punctual than usual that day, or because Ruby Damory
walked slowly, this manœuvre did not have the desired
effect, for, strange to say, the postman overtook her on
the road.</p>

<p>Ruby had heard him coming, and had made valiant
resolution not to look round, but when he came up with
her she could not resist turning towards him, and their
eyes met.</p>

<p>“Did you speak?” said Postman Chris.</p>

<p>“No—I—I—” She stopped short; her heart was
thumping so violently, indeed, that she could scarcely
breathe.</p>

<p>“I thought you might have a letter for me,” she murmured
at last, in the frantic endeavour to cover her
confusion.</p>

<p>“Not I,” said the postman.</p>

<p>He made as if he would pass on, but wheeled round
again. “What have you been doing to yourself?” he
asked sharply.</p>

<p>“I? Oh, nothing.”</p>

<p>“Ye bain’t half the maid ye was,” insisted Chris, eyeing
her with severe disapproval. “Been frettin’ about
summat?”</p>

<p>If Ruby had been pale before, she was rosy enough now.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” she stammered; “what makes
you say that?”</p>

<p>“I thought you mid be disapp’inted-like about that
letter,” responded the postman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>“Oh, the letter. Yes—’tis very strange it doesn’t come.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s none o’ my fault,” retorted Chris roughly.
“Ye needn’t look at me like that. I’d bring it to ye fast
enough if ’twas there.”</p>

<p>“Well, of course—I never thought you wouldn’t. I’m
sure I never said anything——” cried poor Ruby, more
and more agitated.</p>

<p>“Ye shouldn’t go frettin’ yourself though,” he remarked.
“That won’t make it come any faster. And you shouldn’t
blame me.”</p>

<p>“I <i>don’t</i> blame you,” gasped the girl. “I don’t—indeed
I don’t”—but here, in spite of herself, her voice was lost
in a burst of sobs.</p>

<p>Postman Chris set down his bag and produced a khaki
pocket handkerchief—a relic no doubt of South African
days. This he tendered very gallantly to Ruby, who, if
truth be told, was at that moment at a loss for one, having
used her own to wipe out a particularly impracticable sum
from a small pupil’s slate.</p>

<p>She accepted the offering in the spirit in which it was
meant, dried her eyes, and returned the handkerchief to
the postman with a watery smile. At that smile Chris
changed colour, but he tucked away the handkerchief in
his sleeve without a word, respectfully saluted, and departed.
He never looked back at the girl, but as he walked away
he said to himself: “That there maid, she be all I thought
her. ’Tis a pity I didn’t see her afore she took up wi’
t’other chap. I wouldn’t ha’ left her a-pinin’ so long, and
a-waitin’ and a-waitin’ for a letter what never comes. But
she’ll stick to him—ah, sure she’ll stick to him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>And with that he heaved a profound sigh, and turned
off in the direction of the post-office.</p>

<p>The former mode of procedure was now changed. Ruby
locked up the schoolhouse every day after lesson-time
and Postman Chris regularly overtook her on the way
home. By mutual consent they avoided the painful subject
of the letter and conversed on indifferent topics; and
more than once when Chris walked away he muttered
to himself: “She be the prettiest, and she be the wittiest,
and she be—ah, ’tis a dalled pity I weren’t on the field
first.”</p>

<p>One day when the well-known step came up behind
Ruby it was accompanied by a shout:—</p>

<p>“Hi!” cried Postman Chris; “hi! Miss Damory! I’ve
a-got summat for ye at last.”</p>

<p>Ruby turned towards him without any very great elation,
for, if truth be told, a letter from her only correspondent
had never caused her heart to beat one tittle faster than
its wont. But as Chris came up with an excited face she
felt she could do no less than simulate great delight at his
news.</p>

<p>“At last!” cried she, holding out her hand for the letter.
But Chris did not deliver it up at once. He looked up
the road and down the road—it was indeed little more
than a lane, and at that hour solitary enough; there was
a strange flash in his eye.</p>

<p>“This’ll be the end of all between you and me, I suppose?”
said he. “Ye’ll have got your letter, and ye’ll not
care for seein’ me come no more. I’ve a mind to make
you pay for it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>Ruby’s extended hand dropped by her side, and she
started back.</p>

<p>“Here’s a Fine Thing,” said Postman Chris, still with
that gleam in his eye as he held up the letter. “Here’s a
Fine Thing and a very Fine Thing; what’s the owner of
Fine Thing to do?”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” whispered Ruby.</p>

<p>“’Tis your turn to pay the forfeit now!” cried he. “I’ve
bowed to the wittiest and knelt to the prettiest; I’d have
finished the job if you’d ha’ let me. ’Tis your turn, I say;
I’ll let you off all but the last.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you take me for, Chris Ryves,”
cried Ruby tremulously. “I think you should be ashamed
of yourself. You ought to know enough of me by this
time to see that I’m not that kind of girl.”</p>

<p>“Well, I be that kind o’ man,” returned Chris obstinately.
“This here’s the end—this here’s my last chance.
If you want your precious letter, you must pay for it.”</p>

<p>“How dare you?” cried Ruby, turning as white as a
sheet. “You are very much mistaken, Mr. Ryves. I’d
rather die—than—than——”</p>

<p>“Than have anything to say to me,” he interrupted
fiercely. “Oh, I know that very well, Miss Damory;
you’re not for the likes o’ me, as you did show me plain
enough at the beginning of our acquaintance. But a
chap isn’t so very bad if he does ask for a crumb before
the whole loaf is handed over to another man. Give me
one, Ruby—just one!”</p>

<p>Ruby backed away from him against the hedge.</p>

<p>“This is an insult,” she cried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>“An insult!” he repeated, suddenly sobered. “Oh, if
you look on it that way. There’s your letter,” he went
on, dropping his voice. “There’s your letter, Miss Damory;
I hope it’ll give ye every joy and satisfaction.”</p>

<p>And with that he handed the disputed document to the
schoolmistress, took off his hat with a flourish, and marched
away quick time. Not so quick, however, but that a little
petulant cry fell upon his ears, and, wheeling involuntarily,
he saw that the letter had been flung upon the ground,
and that Ruby Damory was leaning against the hedge
with her face buried in her hands.</p>

<p>Chris came back at the double.</p>

<p>“There!” he cried penitently. “I’m a brute beast. I
beg your pardon, my maid. I’m truly sorry—truly, I am.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” sobbed Ruby, “how could you be so unkind?”</p>

<p>“I’m sure I don’t know how I came for to forget myself
like that,” he returned ruefully; “but I’ll never offend
again, Miss Damory—never.”</p>

<p>“To expect me—to—to do that,” faltered Ruby, “when
you’d never said a word of love to me—when you’d never
even asked to walk with me.”</p>

<p>The postman’s brown face assumed a puzzled air; he
drew a step nearer, and picked up the letter.</p>

<p>“But,” said he; then paused, and once more tendered
the document to the schoolmistress.</p>

<p>“Oh, bother!” cried she irritably. “It’ll keep.”</p>

<p>Chris’s countenance lit up suddenly.</p>

<p>“Will it, indeed?” cried he. “That’s a tale—a very
different tale. There, when I was comin’ along wi’ that
letter, ’twas all I could do not to bury it or to drop it into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
a ditch. I mastered myself, ye know, but I were terr’ble
tempted, and that was why,” he added with a sly glance,
“I did look for some reward.”</p>

<p>“But why did you want to destroy my aunt’s letter?”
asked Ruby.</p>

<p>“Your aunt!” exclaimed Chris. “Your <i>aunt</i>! Well,
that beats all.”</p>

<p>He took off his hat and waved it; he danced a kind of
jig upon the footpath; he threw himself sideways against
the hedge, laughing all the while, so that Ruby stared in
amazement. Suddenly he composed himself.</p>

<p>“That be another tale, indeed, my maid,” said he. “I
were a-thinking all the time ’twas your young man you
was expectin’ to hear from. But why was you always so
eager on the look-out for me?”</p>

<p>“I’m sure I wasn’t,” said Ruby, and she blushed to the
roots of her hair. She dared not look at Chris for a full
moment, but at last was constrained to raise her eyes to
his face, and there, lo, and behold! he was blushing too.
And looking at her—yes—with that very self-same expression
which she had seen in his eyes on the morning
when she had first hidden herself behind the blackboard.
He came a step nearer, and his blue-coated arm
began to insinuate itself between the hedge and her trim
waist.</p>

<p>“Then why, my maid,” he began gently—“that there
game, ye know—why didn’t you let me finish?”</p>

<p>“Why,” said Ruby, between laughing and crying, “because
you hadn’t begun.”</p>

<p>He whistled softly under his breath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>“Shall us begin now?” said he. “You and me—we’ll
do it proper this time.”</p>

<p>“Begin courting?” said she innocently.</p>

<p>“Yes, we’ll play the game right. Here’s a Fine Thing
and a very Fine Thing—that’s you, my dear—now what’s
the owner of this Fine Thing to do? The owner—that’s
me—why—this——”</p>

<p>He accompanied the word with appropriate action.</p>

<p>“For shame!” cried she, in a tone which nevertheless
was not displeased, “you’ve begun at the wrong end after
all.”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” he retorted, “’tis the proper way to start a
courtship. I’ll tell ye summat, Ruby, my maid. We’ll
have the banns put up on Sunday.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">KEEPER GUPPY.</h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Lard</span> ha’ mercy me! What be doin’, Jan? You that’s
only jist out o’ your bed! Whatever ’ud Doctor say?
Boots too! Where be goin’?”</p>

<p>Old John Guppy cast a lowering glance at his spouse,
and continued to button his gaiters in silence. This task
concluded, he stretched out his hand and pointed imperatively
to the gun slung over the chimney-piece.</p>

<p>“Reach that down,” he commanded.</p>

<p>“Ye’re never goin’ out! You as has been four month
and more on your back! What’s the use on’t? There’s
a new keeper yonder—new ways, and strangers pretty
nigh everywhere. I’d ha’ had a bit more sperrit nor to
go up there where I bain’t wanted.”</p>

<p>“I be goin’, woman. Squire do pay I money, an’ I’ll
give en his money’s worth. I must have an eye to things,
or they’ll be gettin’ in a reg’lar caddle up yon. New
keeper, he’ll not know so very much about the place, and
Jim—he were always a terr’ble sammy—he never did seem
to see what was under his nose wi’out I were there to rub
it into it.”</p>

<p>“Well, but Jan, the bit o’ money what Squire gives
’ee is a pension—same as what soldiers an’ sick-like do
get i’ their ancient years. Squire don’t expect ’ee to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
do no more work for en now, and ye be so fearful punished
wi’ the rheumatics, an’ all. No—‘Mrs. Guppy,’ says
Squire to I, so considerate as could be, ‘Mrs. Guppy,’ he
says, ‘Jan have served I faithful nigh upon two score year—now
he can take a bit o’ rest,’ he says; ‘I’ve a-made
sure as he’ll be comfortable in’s old age. The pension
’ull be paid reg’lar so long as he do live,’ says he, ‘or so
long as I do live,’ he says, laughin’ cheerful-like, ‘for ’pon
my word, I do think your Jan ’ll very likely see I down—he
be uncommon tough, so old as he mid be,’ says
Squire. ‘And if I do go first, my son ’ll see as he
wants for nothin’ in his time,’ he says. So let I light
your pipe, Jan, my dear, and sit ’ee down sensible like, i’
the chimbley corner—’tis the best place for ’ee, good
man.”</p>

<p>“You can light my pipe, if you like,” said John, still
gloomily, “but I be goin’ up-along all the same. Things
’ull be goin’ to ruin if I don’t tell ’em how they used to be
carried on i’ my time.”</p>

<p>“I d’ ’low ye’ll not get so far,” said Mrs. Guppy; “but
of all the obstinate men—well, there, ’tis a good thing as
the A’mighty made half the world o’ women-folk, else
everythin’ ’ud be fair topsy-turvy.”</p>

<p>John wedged his pipe firmly in the corner of his mouth,
put his gun under his arm, and, taking his thick stick
from the chimney corner, set forth, without vouchsafing
any answer; he limped painfully as he walked, and Mrs.
Guppy, looking sorrowfully after him, opined that he’d
have had enough of it afore he’d gone half a mile. But
though she had been wedded to John for thirty-five years,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
she had not yet learned the quality of his spirit; he
uttered many groans as he shambled along, and lifted the
poor limb, which had so long been well-nigh useless, with
increasing effort, but he held bravely on his way until he
reached his destination, a vast stretch of land, half park,
half down, peopled by innumerable rabbits and furnished
with copses and plantations, which no doubt afforded cover
to game of every kind. Here John paused for the first
time, turned his head on one side, clicked his tongue and
jerked forward his gun with a knowing air as a rabbit
crossed his path.</p>

<p>“If ’t ’ad ha’ been loaded I’d ha’ made short work o’
thee, my bwoy,” he remarked. “There don’t seem to be
so many o’ you about as there did used to be i’ my time,
though—not by a long ways. That there noo chap ’ull ha’
let ye go down, I reckon. There bain’t many like poor
old Jan Guppy—nay, I’ll say that for ye, Jan. You was
worth your salt while you were about—’e-es, and so long
as ye be above ground I d’ ’low you’ll make it worth
Squire’s while to keep ye.”</p>

<p>Having delivered this tribute to himself with a conscientiously
impartial air, he proceeded on his way, and
presently came in sight of the keeper’s cottage, or rather
lodge, set midway in the long avenue which led to the
Squire’s mansion, and smiled to himself at the sudden out-cry
of canine voices which greeted his approach.</p>

<p>“There they be, the beauties! That’s Jet—I’d know her
bark among a thousand. I d’ ’low she knows my foot,” as
one voice detached itself from the chorus and exchanged
its warning note for a strangled whine of rapture. “She’ll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
break that chain o’ hers if they don’t let her loose. ’Ullo,
Jet, old girl! Hi, Rover! Pull up, Bess!”</p>

<p>All the barks had now ceased, and a pointer came scurrying
to the gate, followed by a large retriever.</p>

<p>“There ye be, my lads—too fat, too fat. Ah, they be
feedin’ o’ them too well now—not so good for work, I d’
’low! Poor old Jet! Ye be tied-up, bain’t ye? There,
we’ll come to ye.”</p>

<p>Passing through the wicket-gate, he was limping unceremoniously
round to the back of the cottage, when the
door was thrown open and the astonished figure of the
keeper’s wife appeared in the aperture.</p>

<p>“Mornin’, mum,” said John, lifting his hand half-way
to his forelock, which was his nearest approach to a
polite salutation when in parley with folks of Mrs.
Sanders’ degree. “I be Mr. Guppy, what was keeper
here afore your master. I be jist come to take a look
about.”</p>

<p>“Oh, indeed,” said Mrs. Sanders, who was a very genteel
and superior person; “my husband would have had great
pleasure in taking you round, Mr. Guppy, but he’s out just
at present.”</p>

<p>“No matter for that, mum, I’ll go by myself. What,
Jet! There ye be, my beauty; dear, to be sure, a body
’ud never think ’twas the same dog. She do seem to ha’
fell away terr’ble, mum.”</p>

<p>Jet, a curly-coated black spaniel, was at that moment
straining wildly at her chain, and wriggling her little black
body in such spasms of ecstasy at the sight of her old
master that it would have needed a very sharp eye to detect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
any alteration in her appearance, if, indeed, such existed;
but John spoke in a tone of conviction.</p>

<p>“She bain’t half the dog she were. What do you feed her
on, mum? Jet, she did used to be dainty—didn’t ye, Jet?
Her coat do stare dreadful, mum, now don’t it? A prize
dog didn’t ought to have its coat neglected like that.
When I had the charge o’ she, dally! if I didn’t comb
and brush her morn an’ night, same as if she’d been a
young lady. Be dalled if I didn’t! Where be your
master, mum?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Sanders’ face, always somewhat frosty in expression,
had become more and more pinched and supercilious
during the colloquy, and she now replied extremely distantly
that she couldn’t say for certain where Mr. Sanders
might be, but that very likely he was looking after the
young pheasants.</p>

<p>“Ah!” commented John, with interest; “and where
mid he ha’ got them this year?”</p>

<p>“On this side of the North Plantation,” returned the
lady unwillingly.</p>

<p>“A bad place, mum, a very bad place; no birds ’ull ever
do well there. If he’d a-come to I, I could ha’ telled en
that. They’ll never thrive up yon in that draughty place—no,
that they won’t; and it’ll be too cold for ’em. I’m
afeared he’ll have a bad season. The North Plantation—dear,
some folks doesn’t know much! Well, I’ll go and
have a look at ’em, and if I do see your husband, I mid be
able to gie en a word or two o’ advice.”</p>

<p>“Ho! no need for that, I think,” cried Mrs. Sanders
wrathfully. “’Tisn’t very likely as my husband, wot ’as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
lived in the fust o’ families, and been keeper to a markis,
’ud want to take advice from an old gentleman like you,
Mr. Guppy, as has never left the one place all your life.”</p>

<p>“I could have advised en agen the North Plantation,
anyhow,” said John stolidly. “Well, I’ll wish ’ee good-day,
mum. I’ll be goin’ my ways up-along.”</p>

<p>And he hobbled off, muttering to himself as he went:
“The North Plantation! The chap must be a fool!... They
poor dogs, they was glad to see I!—jist about; but
bain’t he a sammy! There he do go and feed up the
shooting dogs so as they be for all the world like pigs, and
Jet, what we used to keep same as a little queen, he do
seem to take no more notice of nor if she was a cat!
Poor Jet! How she did cry to get to I! Well, well! I
may be able to put things straight a bit.”</p>

<p>Proceeding at his slow pace, the pilgrimage to the North
Plantation was a matter of considerable time, and it was
noon before he halted at length beside the enclosure where
hundreds of tiny pheasant chicks ran in and out of their
several coops, with a venturesomeness much deplored by
their distracted hen foster-mothers.</p>

<p>A tall, middle-aged man was walking about amid the
pens, with a proudly proprietary air which announced him
to be the head-keeper.</p>

<p>Guppy wiped the sweat of weakness and fatigue from
his brow and uttered a quavering “Hullo!” Mr. Sanders
turned and walked majestically towards him.</p>

<p>“What do you want,” he inquired briefly.</p>

<p>“I be jist come up-along to have a look round,” announced
John. “I’m Mr. Guppy, what was here afore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
you. You be in my shoes now, I mid say, but I don’t
bear ’ee no grudge for ’t—no, I don’t bear ’ee no grudge,”
he repeated handsomely.</p>

<p>“Right,” said Sanders, who was a good-humoured fellow
enough, if a little puffed up by the dignity of his position.
“Glad to see you, Mr. Guppy. We’ve got a nice lot here,
haven’t we?”</p>

<p>“’E-es,” agreed Guppy, with a note of reserve in his
voice; “’e-es, a tidyish lot; but you’ll not bring up the
half o’ them.”</p>

<p>“Won’t I, indeed?” retorted Sanders, somewhat warmly.
“What makes you say that?”</p>

<p>“I could ha’ telled ’ee as this here weren’t a fit place
for young pheasants,” returned the ex-keeper, not without
a certain triumph. “If you’d ha’ come to I, I could ha’
telled ye. I’ve a-been thirty-nine year and nine month i’
this place, and I’ve never put the young pheasants here
once—never once. What do you say to that?”</p>

<p>“Well, I say as every man has his own notions,” returned
the other. “You might have a fancy for one
place, as very likely I’d take agen, and, on the other
hand, you seem to have some notion agen this ’ere place,
as <i>I</i> think most suitable.”</p>

<p>“Well, ye’ll find out your mistake, I d’ ’low,” said Guppy
unflinchingly. “Done pretty well wi’ eggs this year?”</p>

<p>“Yes, pretty well on the whole. We had to buy a few
hundreds, but, as I told Mr.——”</p>

<p>“Buy ’em! Buy eggs! You must ha’ managed wonderful
bad. I’ve a-been here nigh upon farty year, and
never bought so much as one—not one. Dally! ’Twill<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
come terr’ble expensive for Squire if ye do carry on things
that way.”</p>

<p>“Something had to be done, you see,” cried Sanders,
who was now beginning to be distinctly nettled. “You
seem to have been such a stick-in-the-mud lot—there was
hardly any game about the place that I could see when I
come.”</p>

<p>“Oh! and weren’t there?” retorted John sarcastically.
“Ye must ha’ poor eyes, Maister Sanders. There, ’twas
what I did use to say to a cousin o’ Squire’s as used to
come shooting here twenty-five years ago, and couldn’t
hit a haystack. ‘There don’t seem to be anything
to shoot, keeper,’ he’d say; and I’d answer back, ‘Ye
must ha’ wonderful poor eyes, sir.’ Ho, ho! he were
a stuck-up sort o’ gentleman as were always a-findin’
fault and a-pickin’ holes, but I mind I had a good laugh
agen him once. ’Twas a terr’ble hot day, and we’d walked
miles and miles, and I were a bit done-up at the end, and
thankful for a sup o’ beer. And he comes up to I, and
says, laughin’ nasty-like, ‘Well, Guppy, you don’t seem
much of a walker. Now, I could go all day.’ ‘’E-es, sir,’
says I, ‘and so can a postman. I d’ ’low your bags ’ad much
same weight at the end o’ your rounds.’”</p>

<p>Sanders vouchsafed no comment on this anecdote, and
John, propping his stick against the paling, proceeded with
much difficulty to climb over it, and to hobble from one
pen to the other, stooping stiffly to inspect the young
birds and the arrangements made for their comfort.</p>

<p>“They big speckly hens is too heavy for these here
delicate little fellows,” he remarked. “Game hens is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
best—’twas what I did always have. ’Tis more in nature
as the game hens should make the best mothers to young
pheasants. They be a poor-looking lot, Maister Sanders.
I did use to have ’em a deal more for’ard at this time o’
year. What be feedin’ ’em on?”</p>

<p>“Now look ’ere, I’m not going to stand any more o’
this,” thundered the keeper, fairly losing his temper. “I’m
not going to have you poking and prying about this place
no longer. You’ve got past your work, and I’m doing it
now. If the Squire’s satisfied, that’s all I need think about.
If he isn’t, he can tell me so.”</p>

<p>“Ha! no man likes bein’ found fault with,” returned
Guppy sententiously; “but sometimes ’tis for their own
good. Now you take a word o’ advice from I, what was
workin’ here afore you was born or thought of very like.”</p>

<p>“I’ll not, then!” cried the other angrily. “Get out o’
this, you old meddler, or I’ll report you to the Squire!”</p>

<p>“You did ought to thank I for not reportin’ of you,”
returned John firmly. “The Squire do think a deal o’ I—a
deal; but I’d be sorry to get a man into trouble as do
seem to be meanin’ well. You mind my words, keeper,
and you’ll find as they’ll come true—ye’ll have a bad
season this year, and maybe ye’ll be a bit more ready to
take advice from them as knows more nor you do. ’Tis
the first year, so I’ll not be hard on ye.”</p>

<p>He had now recrossed the wire, repossessed himself of
his stick, and with a nod of farewell at his irate successor,
turned his steps homewards.</p>

<p>He spent the rest of that day lamenting the direful
changes which had taken place since his own withdrawal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
from active life, and privately resolved to be astir early on
the morrow in order to proceed further with his tour of
investigation.</p>

<p>With the first dawn, therefore, of a lovely spring morning
he left his bed cautiously, dressed in silence, and made
his way out of doors. The cottage which he had occupied
since his resignation of the keepership was situated at the
very end of the village, and as he glanced up the quiet
street he could detect few signs of life. No smoke was
yet stealing upwards into the still air, no cows lowing in
the bartons; the pigeons, indeed, were astir, preening
themselves somewhat sleepily, and cooing in a confidential
undertone, and the clucking of hens was audible here and
there, while more musical bird-voices resounded from trees
and hedgerows. The dew lay heavy on the long grass by
the roadside as John set forth. The morning mists had
not yet disappeared, and the glamour of dawn still enfolded
the world. The dew-washed leaves seemed to be
on fire, as they caught the rosy rays of the morning sun;
every little wayside pool gleamed and glittered. The air
was full of sweet scents, the delicate, distinctive odour of
the primrose being predominant, though here and there
a gush of almost overpowering perfume greeted the old
man’s nostrils, as he passed a wild apple-tree. A kind of
aromatic undertone came forth from damp moss, trunks of
fir-trees, springing young herbage, yet the exquisite fragrance
of the morning itself seemed to belong to none of
these things in particular, but rather to emanate from the
very freshness of the dawn.</p>

<p>Old John, however, plodded onwards, without appearing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
to take heed of his surroundings; once, indeed, he paused
to sniff with a perturbed expression; a fox had passed that
way. His eyes peered warily into the undergrowth, over
the banks, beneath the hedgerows; he paused in traversing
a copse, stooped, uttering an exclamation of astonished disgust,
and some few moments later emerged from the brake
with a bulging pocket and an air of increased importance.</p>

<p>Jim Neale, the under-keeper, had not long started on
his morning beat when he was hailed by a familiar voice,
and turning beheld his former chief.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Maister Guppy, I be pure glad to see you on
your legs again. You be afoot early.”</p>

<p>John surveyed him for a moment with an air of solemn
indignation.</p>

<p>“’Tis jist so well I were afoot a bit early, Jim. You do
want I at your back, I d’ ’low. Which way have you been
a-goin’?”</p>

<p>“Why, same as usual—across the big mead, from our
place, and up-along by top side o’ the park.”</p>

<p>“Jist what I did fancy. You do seem to use your eyes
wonderful well, Jim—jist so well as ever. D’ye mind
how I used to tell ’ee ‘some folks has eyes and some has
none’?”</p>

<p>“Why, what be amiss?”</p>

<p>John, without speaking, put his hand in his pocket, and
drew forth a number of rabbit snares, sticks and all, which
he had picked up and secreted in the copse before-mentioned.</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Jim. “Humph! I wonder who could have
put them there?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>“Why, Branstone folks what be always a-hangin’ about
seekin’ what they can pick up.”</p>

<p>“Well, ’twas a good job ye did chance to come along,
Mr. Guppy. I d’ ’low they didn’t have time to catch
nothin’. There weren’t no rabbits in ’em, was there?”</p>

<p>“There was a rabbit in one of them though,” retorted
John triumphantly; “I’ve a-got en here i’ my pocket.”</p>

<p>“Oh, and have ye?” queried John, eyeing the pocket in
question somewhat askance. “Well, it’s lucky I’ve a-met
ye—ye can hand en over to me i’stead o’ going all the way
up to Sanders.”</p>

<p>“I can hand en over to you, can I? Thank ye kindly,
Maister Jim; ‘findins’ is keepins’—or used to be i’ my
day. Well, of all the cheek! ‘Hand en over,’ says he to
I what has been his maister, I mid say, for fifteen year and
more. Hand en over, indeed!”</p>

<p>Jim, temporarily abashed, pushed his hat a little to the
back of his head, and stared for a moment or two in
silence; then his features relaxed into a slow grin.</p>

<p>“’Pon my word, if it do come to cheek, be dalled if I
could say which of us has the most of it! Ye bain’t keeper
here no longer, Mr. Guppy, and I don’t know as Squire
’ud be altogether pleased if he was to catch you a-pocketin’
one of his rabbits.”</p>

<p>John laughed derisively.</p>

<p>“Squire ’ud know a bit better nor that,” he remarked,
as soon as he had sufficiently composed himself. “Squire
’ud know better than grudge I a rabbit arter all them hundreds
as I’ve a-had the years and years as I were here.
Be ye a-goin’ on now?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>“’E-es I be,” returned Jim, somewhat sulkily.</p>

<p>“Then look sharp, else you’ll very like miss a good few
more things what be under your nose.”</p>

<p>Jim walked away growling to himself that he wasn’t
a-goin’ to have two masters if he knew it, and that it was
enough to be at one man’s beck and call without being
hauled over the coals by folks what had no right to be
there at all.</p>

<p>John, leaning on his stick, watched the receding form,
still with an air of lofty sovereignty, till it had disappeared,
and then took his way homewards, feeling that he had
done a good morning’s work.</p>

<p>It was marvellous how one so decrepit as he could
manage to be as ubiquitous as he thenceforth became.
His bent figure and wrinkled face were perpetually turning
up in most unexpected quarters, to the wrath and occasional
dismay of Mr. Sanders and his underlings, his small keen
eyes frequently detecting some small error or omission
which his quavering voice was immediately uplifted to
denounce and reprehend. Matters reached a climax when,
one sunshiny morning, he discovered the eldest hope of
the Sanders family in the act of climbing a tree in search
of a bird’s nest, and, not content with boxing the urchin’s
ears as soon as he descended to earth again, hauled him
off by the collar to the parental abode. The boy’s outcries
brought his father to the door, accompanied by Jim, who
had chanced to call in for orders.</p>

<p>“See here what I’ve a-caught your bwoy a-doin’ of.
His pocket be chock-full o’ eggs—pigeon eggs. He ha’n’t
a-got no right to go into the woods arter pigeons’ eggs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
I’ve brought en to ’ee, Maister Sanders, so as ye may gie
en a dressin’. I be too old to do it myself. Nay, nay, at
one time I could ha’ fetched him a crack or two what ’ud
ha’ taught en manners. But I bain’t strong enough for that
now.”</p>

<p>“Let go of him—let go at once, I say,” shouted the
indignant parent. “Who gave you leave to interfere?
The lad’s my lad, and it’s none o’ your business to go
meddlin’ with him. Come here, Philip-James; go in to
your mother, boy. He’s mauled you fearful.”</p>

<p>“Well, you must be a soft fellow,” ejaculated John in a
tone of deep disgust. “I couldn’t ha’ believed it! If <i>I</i>
had a-caught a bwoy a-trespassin’ i’ my woods when I was
here, I’d ha’ thrashed him well for ’t—let him be my son
twenty times over.”</p>

<p>“Trespassin’ indeed! You’re a trespasser yourself,”
cried the keeper. “You’ve no business in these woods
at all; you’ve no business to come near the place. I’ll
summons you, see if I don’t.”</p>

<p>“Well, that is a tale!” exclaimed John, leaning against
the gate-post that he might the better indulge in a kind
of crow of ironical laughter. “Trespass—<i>me</i> trespass; me
what was keeper here for nigh upon farty year. Lard ha’
mercy me! What’ll ye say next?”</p>

<p>“Well, but it <i>be</i> trespassin’, you know, Maister Guppy,”
remarked Jim, thrusting his head round the lintel of the
door; “it be trespassin’ right enough. If you was head-keeper
once, you bain’t head-keeper no more. You ha’n’t
got no call to be here at all. It <i>be</i> trespassin’.”</p>

<p>“You hold your tongue, Jim Neale,” retorted John<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
fiercely—“hold your tongue! Who asked you to speak—you
as did ought to be ashamed of yourself for neglectin’
the ferrets same as you do. The big dog-ferret have a-got
the mange terr’ble bad. You bain’t the man to give a
opinion, I d’ ’low.”</p>

<p>Jim, incensed at this sudden home-thrust, uttered a
forcible exclamation, and proceeded with much warmth:
“You’ve a-got a wrong notion i’ your head altogether,
Maister Guppy; you be a-trespassin’ jist the same as you
was a-poachin’ t’other marnin’.”</p>

<p>“Poachin’!” cried John, his face purple with wrath and
his voice well-nigh strangled—“poachin’! Dall ’ee, Jim,
I’ll not stand here to be insulted. There, I’ve a-passed
over a deal—a deal I have. I’ve overlooked it on account
of the many years as we’ve a-worked here together, but
this here be too much. I’ll report ye, Jim Neale, see if I
don’t; and I’ll report you too, Maister Sanders, for insultin’
of I same as you’ve a-done. There’s things as a body
can’t overlook, let him be so good-natured as he mid be,
and there’s times when a man’s dooty do stare en i’ the
face. I’ll report ye this very hour.”</p>

<p>“That’s pretty good,” laughed Sanders. “Upon my
word, that’s pretty good. Maybe Jim an’ me will have
something to report to the Squire too. You’d best come
along with me, Jim, and we’ll see who the Squire listens
to.”</p>

<p>“Come along then,” cried John valiantly, before Neale
had time to answer. “Come along; we’ll see. I bain’t
afeard o’ the Squire. The Squire do know I so well as if
I was his own brother. Come on, if you be a-comin’.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>The three set out, walkin’ shoulder to shoulder in grim
silence, the younger perforce accommodating their pace to
the slow gait of the old man, who hobbled along between
them, leaning heavily upon his stick, his face set in resolute
lines.</p>

<p>They were kept waiting for some little time until the
Squire had finished his breakfast, but were presently admitted
into the billiard-room where they found him smoking
by a blazing wood fire, for he was of a chilly temperament,
and though the morning was sunny, the air was still sufficiently
sharp.</p>

<p>“Hallo, Guppy!” he cried cheerily, as his eyes fell on
the old man. “What! you’re about again, are you? You’re
a wonderful old fellow! You’ll see me down, I’m sure,
though there are twenty years or so between us.”</p>

<p>John pulled his forelock and then laid his gnarled hand
in the Squire’s outstretched palm.</p>

<p>“You’re a splendid old chap,” said his former master, as
he shook it warmly. “I must own I never thought to see
you on your legs again after that stroke, coming as it did
on the top of the rheumatics. How are the rheumatics,
John?”</p>

<p>“Very bad, thank ye, sir. There, I can scarce turn i’
my bed, and when I do try for to walk my limbs do seem
to go all twisty-like. I be fair scraggled wi’ it, Squire.”</p>

<p>“Well, men, what brought you here?” inquired their
master, turning for the first time to the keepers, and
addressing them with some surprise.</p>

<p>“Why, a rather unpleasant matter, sir, I am sorry to
say,” returned Sanders respectfully, but a trifle tartly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
“’Tis a bit difficult to explain, seein’ as you seem so taken
up with Mr. Guppy here. I understood, sir, when I
accepted your sitooation as I was to have a free hand. I
didn’t look for no interference from anybody but you yourself,
sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, haven’t you got a free hand? I’m sure I don’t
interfere,” replied the Squire, with a shrug of his shoulders.</p>

<p>“’Tis Maister Guppy what be al’ays a-meddlin’, sir!”
put in Jim, with a pull at his forelock. “He do come up-along
mostly every mornin’, a-horderin’ and a-pickin’ holes
here, there, and everywhere. Mr. Sanders and me do find
it terr’ble ill-conwenient.”</p>

<p>“I was just going to say, sir,” resumed Sanders, “when
Neale interrupted me”—here he paused to glare at his
inferior—“as it was what I was never accustomed to—outside
people comin’ and pokin’ and pryin’ and fault-findin’
and interferin’——”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear, how much more!” exclaimed the Squire,
looking from one to the other in affected dismay, mingled
with a little real vexation. “Guppy, what’s all this about?”</p>

<p>“Playse ye, sir, I couldn’t a-bear to see you a-treated
same as ye be treated by them as ye puts your trust in.
Everythin’ be in a reg’lar caddle all over the place—everythin’
be a-goin’ wrong, sir, and when I sees it, I tells
’em of it. I can’t do no different—’tis my dooty. You
do pay I by the week reg’lar, and I bain’t a-goin’ to eat
the bread o’ idleness—’t ’ud stick i’ my in’ards—’e-es, that
it would. ‘So soon as I do get upon my legs,’ says I, ‘I’ll
have a look round;’ and I did have a look round, and
what did I find? Every blessed thing a-goin’ wrong—so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
I sarces ’em for ’t. I wasn’t a-goin’ to hold my tongue, and
see you tricked and abused. I was easy wi’ ’em—a dalled
sight too easy—I did ought to have reported of ’em before,
but to-day I couldn’t stand it no longer; when I did speak
to ’em they up and insulted me, both on ’em. ’E-es, they
did. They insulted of I shameful.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry to hear that——” the Squire was beginning,
when Mr. Sanders, losing patience, interrupted him.</p>

<p>“Begging your pardon, sir, ’tis more than flesh and blood
can stand; ’tis got to be him or me—that’s all I can say.
Nobody could put up with it. I found things in a very
bad state when I came, and I’m getting them better
gradual, sir, and doing my dooty in all respects as well as
I can; but if Guppy is to be allowed to come pryin’ and
spyin’ after me, and findin’ fault with all my arrangements——”</p>

<p>“He did call I a trespasser,” broke out John, who had
been ruminating over his private woes, without taking heed
of the keeper’s indictment. “He did call I a trespasser;
he did say I was trespassin’ when I told en I’d a-been
walkin’ through the Long Wood yonder where I did catch
his little rascal of a son a-bird’s-nestin’ so bold as you
playse. And Jim there, what did ought to know better,
up and said I was poachin’ last week. <i>Me</i> poachin’! Me
what brought him back that very day a dozen o’ snares
what I had picked up i’ the hedge as he went gawkin’
past without taking a bit o’ notice of.”</p>

<p>“’E-es, but you found a rabbit in one and popped it
into your pocket!” cried Jim irefully. “Popped it into
your pocket and walked off wi’ it, let I say what I would.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>“In course I did,” retorted John, with great dignity, “in
course I did. ’Tweren’t very likely as I’d leave it wi’ you.
As I telled ’ee at the time—says I: ‘Squire wouldn’t
grudge me a rabbit now arter all the hundreds as I’ve
a-had while I was keeper up yonder.’”</p>

<p>The Squire covered his mouth with his hand, but tell-tale
wrinkles appeared about his eyes, and the points of
his moustache curled significantly upwards. After a
moment he recovered himself sufficiently to desire the
keepers to withdraw, announcing that he would have a
quiet talk with John Guppy, and that no doubt the matter
could be arranged.</p>

<p>“So you had hundreds of rabbits while you were in my
service, John,” he remarked, crossing one leg over the
other, and looking at the old man with a smile. “Didn’t
you get very tired of them?”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, my old woman be wonderful with the cookin’,
and she did do ’em up in a-many different ways. ’E-es,
we did use to have a rabbit for dinner four days out of
seven.”</p>

<p>“Did you indeed?” returned his former master, much
interested in these revelations. “Do you suppose, John,
the other men had hundreds of rabbits every year, too?”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, it be a matter o’ taste. Some folks doesn’t
fancy rabbit; but, of course, they can take so many as
they do want.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” agreed the Squire.</p>

<p>“’E-es; keepers takes rabbits same as gardeners helps
theirselves to cabbages. I knowed you’d never begrudge
me that there little un.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>“No, to be sure; but we mustn’t be too hard on Jim.
Jim was doing what he thought to be his duty. Now, you
know, no matter how many rabbits a keeper may take for
himself, he is not supposed to allow other people to take
any.”</p>

<p>“Nay, sir, nay; I wouldn’t expect it—not other folks.
But I d’ ’low it be different wi’ I, what was head over en
for so many year. He didn’t ought to ha’ gone and
insulted of I.”</p>

<p>“No, no, of course not; but then, you see, you had
vexed him. He was too angry to discriminate between
poaching and—just helping yourself.”</p>

<p>“And t’other chap, ’ee telled I I was trespassin’!” resumed
John wrathfully.</p>

<p>“Well, my dear John, we must consider the point of
view. Every man has his own, you know. As a matter
of fact, I’m afraid, from Sanders’s point of view, you were
trespassing.”</p>

<p>John’s face was a study.</p>

<p>“I never thought to live to hear you say that, Squire.”</p>

<p>“I only said from his point of view,” cried the Squire,
hastily. “He’s naturally, perhaps, a little jealous; you
were here so many years, you know, and of course, like all
young men—young men will have foolish notions, John—he
thinks his way is the best way. We old fogies must
just give in for the sake of peace and comfort.”</p>

<p>“Noo ways,” agreed the old man, sorrowfully; “noo
folks and noo ways.”</p>

<p>“As you heard me say just now,” resumed his master,
“<i>I</i> don’t interfere with him, and, upon my life, I think it’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
better you shouldn’t interfere, John. I fancy it would be
wiser if you could just keep away for a little bit—then no
one could say you were trespassing, you know.”</p>

<p>“I’ll keep away, Squire,” said John. “No fear; I’ll
keep away. Ye’ll not have to tell I that twice.”</p>

<p>“You and I are free to have our own opinions, of course,”
urged the Squire, smiling, “but we’ll keep them to ourselves—these
young folks you know——”</p>

<p>But John did not smile in return; his head, always bent,
drooped almost to his breast, his lips moved, but uttered
no sound. After a moment or two, he pulled his forelock,
scraped his leg, and turned to depart.</p>

<p>“You’re not going, John?”</p>

<p>“’E-es, sir, I be goin’, I bain’t wanted here no more.
As you do say, noo times——”</p>

<p>“Now, now, I can’t have you going away offended.
Don’t you see how it is, John?”</p>

<p>“Nay, sir, I don’t see nothin’ but what you’ve a-gone
and thrown over a old servant for a noo un. That be all
as I can see. You didn’t check en for insultin’ of I, and
you did uphold him and made little of I. I be goin’, and
you’ll never be troubled wi’ I again. I’m fit for nothin’. I
be a-eatin’ of your bread and a-takin’ of your money and
doin’ nothin’ for ’t. Eatin’ the bread o’ idleness! I d’ ’low
it ’ull fair choke I.”</p>

<p>The Squire, vexed and perplexed, in vain sought to soothe
him, but he waved aside all attempts at consolation, and
made his way slowly out of the room and out of the house.</p>

<p>The Squire watched him as he went tottering down the
avenue. “What’s to be done?” he said to himself. “The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
poor old chap is past his work; it would be cruelty to
allow him to attempt it. Sanders is an excellent fellow,
on the other hand—more go-ahead than dear old John,
and, it must be owned, a better keeper. He would certainly
have given notice if I had allowed John to continue
his visitations here. It is the only thing to be done, but I
can’t bear to see the poor old fellow so cut up.”</p>

<p>As Guppy passed the keeper’s lodge the dogs ran forward,
leaping upon him and whining. He patted them
absently, and then pushed them off. “Down, Rover,
down! There, Bessie, off wi’ you; you should learn a
lesson fro’ your betters. Stick to the noo folks, and get
rid of the wold. Poor beasts! they be fain to see I, I d’
’low. Dogs bain’t like Christians. They don’t seem to
know when a man be down. They be faithful, all the
same; they haven’t a-got no sense, poor things.”</p>

<p>He was spent and trembling when he arrived at his own
home, and sank down in his chair by the hearth.</p>

<p>“There, missis, put away my gun; I’ll not want it no
more; I be done wi’ it—I be done wi’ everythin’. I could
wish that there stroke had a-carried I off. I bain’t no use
i’ this world as I can see. It do seem a strange thing as
the Lard ’ll leave ye to live on and on when folks be tired
o’ ye, and be a-wishin’ of ye under the sod. I wish I were
i’ my long home—aye, that I do.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Guppy was at first alarmed, then affected, and
finally burst into tears.</p>

<p>“I’m sure I never did hear a man go on the same as you
do, Jan; there, I be all of a tremble. What’s amiss?
What’s come to ye? What’s it all about?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>“Gi’ I my pipe,” said John; “there’s things a woman
can’t understand.”</p>

<p>Not another word could she extract from him till dinner-time,
when she summoned him to table.</p>

<p>He gazed at the food sourly. “All charity!” he murmured.
“Charity, woman. I be eatin’ what I haven’t
earned. I may jist so well go to the Union.”</p>

<p>A few days later the Squire’s dogcart drew up at the
little gate, and the Squire himself descended therefrom,
carrying a couple of rabbits which he extracted from under
the seat.</p>

<p>“Good-day, John; good-day, Mrs. Guppy. Well, John,
how are you? Cheering up a bit, I hope.”</p>

<p>John shook his head slowly.</p>

<p>“I’ve brought you a couple of rabbits,” continued the
Squire. “It never struck me till the other day how you
must miss them. I’ll send you some every week. There
are enough, Heaven knows.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want no rabbits,” growled Guppy; “I bain’t
a-goin’ to eat of ’em.”</p>

<p>“John!” gasped his wife, hardly believing her ears.</p>

<p>“Put ’em back i’ the cart, woman,” he continued; “I
bain’t a-goin’ to eat no rabbits what they chaps up yonder
have a-ketched.”</p>

<p>“Why, John,” said the Squire, sitting down beside him,
“can’t you get over it? I thought you would be all right
by this time.”</p>

<p>“I bain’t all right, Squire, and I can’t get over it. Nay,
look at it which way I will, I can’t. Here be I, John
Guppy, a bit scram and a bit wambly; but so sound i’ the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
head as ever I was, whatever my legs mid be. Here be I,
anxious for to do my dooty, and able for to do my dooty,
and you won’t let I do it. You do give me money what
I haven’t earned; you do want I to sit here idle when I’m
as ready for a day’s work as any o’ they new-fangled chaps
what you’ve a-set up yonder i’ my place.”</p>

<p>The Squire sighed and looked hopelessly at Mrs. Guppy,
who stood with her hands folded limply at her waist, and
a most dolorous expression on her countenance, shaking
her head emphatically at every pause in her husband’s
speech. After a few further attempts at consolation, the
Squire rose and went to the door, followed by his hostess.</p>

<p>“What is to be done, Mrs. Guppy?” he inquired, when
they were out of earshot. “I positively can’t have him
back up there—he isn’t fit for it; and he has been setting
all the other men by the ears.”</p>

<p>“He’s fair breakin’ ’is ’eart,” murmured Mrs. Guppy
dolefully. “He thinks he bain’t o’ no use—and he bain’t—and
it’s killin’ ’im. If he could even fancy he was doing
summat and ockipy hisself in any way he’d be a different
man. ’Tis the thought as nobody wants en what do cut
en so.”</p>

<p>The Squire cogitated, and then a sudden light broke
over his face.</p>

<p>“I have it,” he cried. “I have thought of a job for the
old fellow! We’ll put him to rights yet, Mrs. Guppy—see
if we don’t!”</p>

<p>He re-entered the cottage, and approached the inglenook
where John still sat, leaning forward, and slowly
rubbing the knees of his corduroys.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>“John,” he said, “I was almost forgetting a most important
thing I wanted to say to you. Sanders and Jim
have got their hands pretty full up there, as you know.”</p>

<p>“I d’ ’low they have,” agreed Guppy; “they’re like to
have ’em too full, seein’ as they don’t know how to set
about their work nohow.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes. Well, Sanders is very busy all day and Jim
has a wide beat. Neither of them ever find time to go
near the river. It’s my private belief, John, that that
river is dreadfully poached. We’ve next to no wild duck,
you know.”</p>

<p>“We never did have none, sir,” interrupted Guppy.</p>

<p>“Just what I say,” agreed his master; “we never had
the chance. You had <i>your</i> hands pretty full when you
were head-keeper, hadn’t you?”</p>

<p>“I weren’t one what ’ud ever ha’ let ’em get empty,”
growled Guppy.</p>

<p>“Well, I was thinking, now that you haven’t very much
to do, you might undertake the control of those meadows
down there by the river, if you feel up to it, and it’s not
asking too much of you.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I could do it,” returned John, in a mollified tone;
“I could do it right enough if I was let.”</p>

<p>“I should be very much obliged to you,” resumed the
Squire, “very much obliged indeed. All that part of the
property has got shamefully neglected. I imagine the
people think they’ve got a right-of-way.”</p>

<p>“Very like they do,” agreed John, whose countenance
was gradually clearing; “but I can soon show ’em whether
they have or not.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>“Just so. Well, will you undertake to look after that
part of the estate for me? It will be a great relief to my
mind. Don’t overtire yourself, you know; but any day
that you are feeling pretty fit you might stroll round, and
just keep a sharp look-out.”</p>

<p>“’E-es, I could do that,” said John, after considering for
a moment; “I could do it all right, Squire. I will look
into the matter.”</p>

<p>“That’s right. Thank you very much, John. I shall
feel quite satisfied about it now.”</p>

<p>He nodded, and went away, John looking after him
with a satisfied expression.</p>

<p>“I never did mind obligin’ the Squire,” he remarked
to his wife, “and I’m glad to do en a bit of a good
turn i’ my ancient years. ’Tis true what he do say,
that there bit down by the river have a-been fearful
neglected. I myself could never make time to go down
there, and ’t ain’t very likely as these here chaps ’ull go
out of their way to look round. I’ll put it to rights,
though.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure it’s very good o’ you, John,” said Mrs. Guppy,
who had listened to the foregoing colloquy with a somewhat
mystified air. “I shouldn’t ha’ thought that there
was anything worth lookin’ arter down there. Why, the
town boys do bathe there reg’lar i’ the summer.”</p>

<p>“They’ll not bathe there any more,” returned her lord
resolutely. “I’ll teach Mr. Sanders a lesson—I’ll larn ’em
how to see arter a place as it did ought to be looked arter!
Reach me down that gun, woman!”</p>

<p>He sallied forth that very hour, drawing up his little,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
bent form to as close an approach to straightness as he
could manage.</p>

<p>His first care on reaching his destination was to examine
the gates that gave access to this stretch of meadow-land.
He pursed his nether lip and shook his head disapprovingly
at their shaky condition, making a mental resolution
to repair them at the earliest opportunity, and moreover
to see that they were provided with padlocks. After
diligently hunting in the neighbouring wood, he discovered
a half-defaced board, which had at one time borne the
legend, “Trespassers will be prosecuted,” and, with a sigh
of satisfaction, placed it in a more prominent position.</p>

<p>His joy was extreme when, late in the afternoon, he
discovered an honest labouring man in the act of climbing
a gate, which, owing to the rickety condition of its hinges,
could not be opened without risk of falling flat upon the
ground.</p>

<p>“Where be goin’ to?” inquired John, sternly.</p>

<p>“Why, jist home-along,” returned the other, with a good-humoured
smile; “’tis a bit of a short cut this way.”</p>

<p>“There’s to be no more short cuts here,” cried John,
with a certain almost malignant triumph. “These here
meadows belongs to Squire. They’m his private property.”</p>

<p>The man’s jaw dropped. “That’ll be summat noo,” he
said doubtfully, but still good-humouredly.</p>

<p>“’Tis noo times all round,” replied Guppy, with an odd
contraction of the face, “but these ’ere reg’lations ’ull be
carried out strict. You jist turn about, my bwoy.”</p>

<p>“I be three parts there now,” protested the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>“Then you’ll have to step back three parts, that’s all,”
responded Guppy unmoved.</p>

<p>The man scratched his head, stared, and finally recrossed
the gate, and walked away, grumbling to himself,
Guppy looking after him with a sense of well-nigh forgotten
dignity. He had vindicated the majesty of the
law.</p>

<p>All hitherto unconscious trespassers had thenceforth a
bad time of it under the reign of the new river-keeper.
Would-be bathers, small boys on bird’s-nesting intent,
tired women with market-baskets, labourers on their way
to and from their daily work, were ruthlessly turned back
by old Guppy, whose magisterial air carried conviction
with it. The other keepers, laughing perhaps in their
sleeves, let him pursue his tactics unmolested, and the
Squire was careful to congratulate him from time to time
on the success of his labours. John Guppy’s greatest
triumph was, perhaps, when he actually did discover a
wild duck’s nest amid the sedges of the now tranquil
river. How tenderly he watched over it; how proudly
he noted the little brood of downy ducklings when they
first paddled from one group of reeds to another in the
wake of their mother; with what delight he imparted his
discovery to the Squire, and with what supreme joy did
he invite him to set about the destruction of these precious
charges when they were sufficiently grown! Almost
equal rapture was his when, having struggled along the
avenue with a brace of ducks dangling from each hand, he
encountered the head-keeper in the shrubbery.</p>

<p>“Those are fine ones,” remarked Sanders, good-naturedly;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
he was a good-hearted fellow in the main, and did not
grudge the old man his small successes.</p>

<p>“I should think they was,” returned Guppy, swelling with
pride. “They be uncommon fine uns, Maister Sanders;
they be the only wild duck what was ever seen on this
here property. I be glad to hear,” he added, condescendingly,
“as you’ve done pretty well wi’ the pheasants, too.
Squire was a-tellin’ me about the good season ye did
have.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” rejoined the keeper, with a twinkle in his eye;
“they didn’t turn out so bad, you see, Mr. Guppy.”</p>

<p>“I be very glad on’t, I’m sure,” said John, still condescendingly;
“of course it be easy to rear a good few
pheasants if you do go in for buyin’ eggs; it bain’t so very
easy to get wild duck to take to a place where they never
did come afore.”</p>

<p>“No, to be sure,” agreed Sanders affably. “It was a
wonderful piece of luck, that was.”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t luck, Maister Sanders,” said John impressively,
“it was knowledge.”</p>

<p>And he walked on, with conscious pride in every line
of face and figure, leaving his successor chuckling.</p>

</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Where</span> be goin’, William?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I be jest steppin’ up to the Pure Drop.”</p>

<p>And William Faithfull brought back his abstracted gaze
from the horizon, where it habitually rested when it was
not required for practical purposes in the exercise of his
profession, and fixed itself somewhat shamefacedly on his
interlocutor.</p>

<p>He was a tall, loose-limbed man, of about forty, with an
expression of countenance chronically dismal, except at
such times when he was employed in some particularly
genial task, such as making a coffin, or repairing the church
trestles, when his neighbours averred that he became quite
lively, and even whistled as he worked.</p>

<p>His crony now returned his glance with a jocular one,
and slapped his thigh ecstatically.</p>

<p>“Well, I never seed such a chap! Faithfull by name
and faithful by natur’—ah, sure you are. Why, ’tis nigh
upon twelve year, bain’t it, since ye started coortin’ Martha
Jesty?”</p>

<p>“Somewhere about that,” replied William; and his
countenance, already ruddy in the sunset glow, assumed a
still deeper tint.</p>

<p>“Well, I never!” returned the other with a shout of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
laughter. “She be gettin’ on pretty well, now—I d’ ’low
she’ll be a staid woman by the time you wed her.”</p>

<p>William shifted uneasily from one foot to the other.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, after a pause, “I d’ ’low she be worth
waitin’ for. She be wonderful clever, Martha be—an’ that
sprack! No, I don’t regret it—not at all I don’t.”</p>

<p>“Bain’t the wold man anyways comin’ round?” inquired
his friend with his head on one side.</p>

<p>“No,” returned Faithfull gloomily. “Not at all. But
he be so terr’ble punished, poor wold chap, one can’t
expect rayson off he.”</p>

<p>“’Tis the rheumatics, bain’t it?” was the next query in
a commiserating tone.</p>

<p>“’Tis the sky-attics,” replied the carpenter, not without
a certain pride in his pseudo-father-in-law’s distinguished
ailment. “There, he be so scraggled as anything—all
doubled up by times. Martha do say he goes twisty-like
same as a eel, when it do take en real bad.”</p>

<p>“Lard, now!” ejaculated the other.</p>

<p>“’E-es,” said William, shaking his head—“that’s how it
do take en. So, as Martha do say, ye can’t expect the
onpossible. ‘If my father,’ says she, ‘be so scram-like in
his out’ard man, how can ye look for en to act straight-forrard?
He’ve a-set his mind again’ the notion of us
gettin’ wed, so we must just wait till he be underground.
And then,’ says she, ‘I’ll not keep ’ee waitin’ a minute
longer.’”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s handsome,” agreed the friend, “but I’m
afeard, William, that there complaint bain’t like to carry
en off very soon—no, not so very soon. Nay, I’ve a-knowed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
folks keep on a-livin’ in a way that ’ud surprise
ye, as was fair bent in two wi’ pains in all their j’ints. I
reckon you’ll very like go first yerself, William.”</p>

<p>After a pause of deep depression the carpenter’s face
lighted up.</p>

<p>“The sky-attics, d’ye see, Tom,” he explained condescendingly—“the
sky-attics is a new-fayshioned ailment,
an’ a deal dangerouser nor the wold rheumatiz an’ newralgy
and sich. Why, when I did mention to Parson
t’other day about wold Jesty’s sky-attics he did laugh.
‘Sky-attics,’ says he. ‘Then he’ll be like to go up’ards afore
very long,’ says he. Well, so long, Tom; I must be steppin’
up-along now.”</p>

<p>“Ye’ll find the wold fellow a bit tilty,” remarked Tom;
“whether them there ’attics was troublin’ en or not I can’t
say, but he was a-shoutin’ an’ a bally-raggin’ o’ that poor
faymale while I was drinkin’ my drap o’ beer jist now, till
I wonder she wasn’t dathered.”</p>

<p>William’s recent elation disappeared; he vouchsafed no
comment on the unwelcome news, however, but with a
sidelong nod at his crony, shambled away, swinging his
long limbs as though every joint of them was loose.</p>

<p>The Pure Drop was situated a stone’s throw from the
village, and stood at the junction of four cross-roads; a
most excellent position, which enabled it to waylay, as it
were, not only the inhabitants of the hamlet as they set
forth for or returned from their day’s vocations, but to
capture most of the travellers who journeyed that way—cyclists
galore, wagoners, dusty pedestrians. It must be
owned that the aspect of the little place was inviting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
enough to tempt even a teetotaller; the low red-brick
house overgrown with creepers, the mullioned windows
winking brightly in the sun in summer, and in winter
letting streams of ruddy firelight flow forth. It was so
clean and airy, so cosy and trim, that those who went
thither for the first time vowed they would return again,
and old customers nodded knowingly, and declared that
the place had not its like in the country. The liquor was
good, while prudent folk who called for tea might have
it, and a crusty home-baked loaf into the bargain, and
a roll of fresh butter of Martha’s making.</p>

<p>Then Martha herself—though she was no longer in the
first bloom of youth, she was a tidy, clean-skinned, pleasant-looking
little body; and if her eye was sharp and her
tongue ready, she was none the less popular on these
accounts; every one got hauled over the coals from time to
time, and when it was not your turn it was pleasant enough
to see other folks made to look foolish.</p>

<p>Miss Jesty was standing in the open doorway when her
lover came up, and immediately made a warning sign to
him.</p>

<p>“Ye mustn’t come in to-night, William. Father—there!
he’s something awful this evenin’, an’ he’ve a-been on the
look-out for ye, so to speak, ever since dinner-time. Whenever
the door do go, ‘There,’ he’ll cry, ‘is that that good-for-nothin’
William Faithfull?’ Or if there’s a knock,
‘’Tis that sammy o’ thine, for sure,’ he’ll say.”</p>

<p>“Oh, an’ does he?” returned poor William, with a
deeper expression of melancholy.</p>

<p>Martha nodded portentously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>“Ye mustn’t come in to-day,” she said with decision;
“no, not even for a minute. Father, he did say to I jist
now, as whatever happened he wouldn’t have no cwortin’
here. ‘If ye can have the heart to think about cwortin’
when I’m so bad as I be,’ says he, ‘I’ll take an’ alter my
will.’ So there’s nothin’ for it but for you to turn about
an’ go home again.”</p>

<p>“I weren’t so much thinkin’ o’ cwortin’ this evenin’,
Martha,” said the swain very meekly. “I wer’ lookin’ for
a drap o’ beer—I be terr’ble dry.”</p>

<p>Martha hesitated for a moment, and in this interval a
kind of bellow sounded from the interior of the house.</p>

<p>“That’s him,” she cried in terror. “No, William, ye
can’t have no beer to-night. I dursen’t stay another
minute. Go home-along, do, an’ if ye be so thirsty as
that comes to, can’t ye get a bottle o’ ‘pop’ off Mrs.
Andrews?”</p>

<p>William gazed at her blankly, but before he could protest
his charmer had disappeared within the house, and he
was forced very dolefully to retrace his steps. He did
indeed purchase the bottle of “pop,” but found it by no
means exhilarating; in fact, as he laid his head on the
pillow that night he was tempted to think he might pay
too high a price even for the hope of becoming one
day Martha’s husband.</p>

<p>When on the following Sunday evening, however, he
walked in the shady lane hand-in-hand with his sweetheart,
he forgot how irksome was this time of trial, and
listened with the melancholy satisfaction which was his
nearest approach to cheerfulness (on ordinary occasions)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
to the glowing picture with which she depicted the reward
earned by his constancy.</p>

<p>“I do r’alely think as poor father be a-breakin’ up,” she
remarked consolingly. “When winter comes I reckon
he’ll not be able to hold out. Well,” she added piously,
“’tis what comes to us all, soon or late, an’ I’m sure he be
well prepared, for I don’t think he’ve a-had a day’s health
this twenty year. ’Twill be a mercy when he do go, poor
wold man. An’ the winter ’ud be a very nice time for us
to get married, William; ’twould suit us very well, wouldn’t
it?”</p>

<p>“Ah, sure,” said William, with a slow smile.</p>

<p>“We shouldn’t be so busy then, d’ye see,” resumed
Martha. “The harvestin’ ’ud be done an’ the potato-gettin’;
an’ there wouldn’t be so many by-cyclists—there’s
not so much goin’ backwards an’ forrards in winter-time.
We shouldn’t be at much loss if we was to take a holiday.”</p>

<p>“Ah,” said William, with mournful rapture, “you was
thinkin’ of us takin’ a holiday, was ye, Martha?”</p>

<p>“I thought we mid go to London,” cried Miss Jesty
triumphantly. “I have always longed to go to London
an’ see the sights there, an’ go to the theayters. There!
Susan Inkpen as wed Miller Dewey did go up to London
for her honeymoon.”</p>

<p>“For her what?” interrupted Faithfull.</p>

<p>“For her honeymoon—her weddin’ journey—the jaunt
what folks do take when they gets wed.”</p>

<p>“Oh, to be sure,” said the carpenter. “An’ you an’ me
be to go to London for our honeymoon, be we?”</p>

<p>“’E-es,” cried Martha with a chuckle. “We’ll have a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
rale week’s pleasurin’, you an’ me. If ’tis winter-time—as
most like ’twill be, on account o’ poor father’s sky-attics,
you know—the pantomines ’ull be goin’ on. Susan Dewey
did go, an’ she said they was the wonderfullest things, wi’
fairies an’ mermaids, an’ sich-like, an’ Clown an’ Pantaloon
a-knockin’ of each other about. There, she an’ her husband
did fair split their sides wi’ laughin’.”</p>

<p>William appeared to survey this prospect stolidly, and
made no comment, and Miss Jesty continued eagerly:—</p>

<p>“Then there’d be the Waxworks, an’ the Zoo, where
all the wild beasts is kept; an’ we’d go an’ see the Tower
o’ London, where all the king’s jools an’ suits of armour is
set out, an’ we’d go to Westminster Abbey——”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” inquired Mr. Faithfull dubiously.</p>

<p>Martha was taken aback for a moment.</p>

<p>“Susan went to see it,” said she hesitatingly, “so I
s’pose ’tis worth lookin’ at. ’Tis a wold ancient church.”</p>

<p>“A wold church?” repeated William, shaking his head.
“I d’ ’low I shouldn’t care so much to see that. I’d sooner
wait till ’twas done-up fresh-like. I never cared at all for
goin’ into our church till the Rector had it cleaned and
painted-up so good as new. I think ’t ’ud be a foolish
kind o’ thing to go trapesin’ off to yon—what-d’-ye-call-it—Abbey
till they get it repaired.”</p>

<p>“Maybe not,” agreed Martha cheerfully; “there’s
plenty more to be seen wi’out that. Well, I hope the
Lord ’ull spare father so long as it be good for en, poor
dear man, but if he was to be took, I hope as it may be
in the winter, William.”</p>

<p>William, who had been trailing beside her arm-in-crook,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
suddenly stopped short and faced her with a determined
air.</p>

<p>“Whether he do go in winter or whether he do go in
summer, Martha,” said he, “you an’ me must be called
home so soon as he be laid underground, mind that.”</p>

<p>And having come to the turn in the lane where they
usually parted, William went his way, leaving Martha
somewhat in doubt whether to be pleased at this proof of
ardour or indignant at the sudden display of spirit.</p>

<p>A wilful woman is proverbially supposed to have her
way, yet it sometimes happens that, even when she proposes,
Heaven disposes events otherwise than she would
have had them. Thus, though Martha Jesty had made
arrangements for her father to depart this life in the winter—a
time when business should be conveniently slack—that
worthy old gentleman was removed from this earthly
sphere in the very height of summer, when the harvest
was in full swing, and more than an ordinary number of
tourists halted daily for refreshment at the Pure Drop.</p>

<p>Tidings of this melancholy event were imparted to
William by a group who entered his yard on the morning
of the occurrence, each eager to be the first to tell the news.
That old Mr. Jesty was gone was an incontrovertible fact,
but none of the newsmongers could agree as to the precise
ailment which had carried him off. He had had a bit of a
cold for a day or two, but while some said it had turned to
“browntitus,” others were sure it was “poomonia,” and
one shrill-voiced old lady delivered it as her opinion that
nothing short of an “apple-complex” could have carried
him off that sudden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>Beyond sundry “ohs” and “ahs” and grunts indicative
of surprise and sympathy, William made no remark, though
when one facetious bystander observed that it would be his
turn next—a somewhat obscure phrase, which might be
interpreted in a variety of ways—he grinned appreciatively.</p>

<p>No sooner had the gossips departed, however, than he
went indoors and assumed his coat, and immediately betook
himself, not to the Pure Drop, but to the Rectory.</p>

<p>“The Reverend,” as his parishioners frequently called
him, was sitting in his study, tranquilly reading his <i>Times</i>,
when William Faithfull was ushered in.</p>

<p>“You’ll have heard the noos, sir,” he began abruptly;
“old Abel Jesty up to the Pure Drop, he’s gone at last.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said the Rector, looking rather startled; “that’s
sudden, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“’E-es,” said William, with a wooden face; “sudden but
not unpre-pared. Martha has been a-lookin’ for en to go
this ten year.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said the Rector again, this time a little uncertainly.</p>

<p>“’E-es,” resumed William; “I thought I’d call an’ tell
ye, so as ye need lose no time in settling things.”</p>

<p>“About the funeral, I suppose you mean?” put in the
clergyman as he paused.</p>

<p>“No,” said William, who was gazing not only over the
Rector’s head, but apparently through the wall at some
distant sky-line; “about the weddin’—mine an’ Martha’s.
Ye mid call us over on Sunday.”</p>

<p>“Really, William, I think that is too sudden,” said the
Rector; “why, the poor old man won’t have been dead
a week!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>“He be so dead as ever he’ll be,” returned William, still
gazing impenetrably at that far point in an imaginary
horizon. “Martha an’ I have a-made it up years ago,
an’ settled as she’d not keep me waitin’ no longer after
her father was took. I’ll thank ye to call us home, sir.”</p>

<p>And with that he scraped a leg and pulled his forelock
and withdrew, leaving the Rector, half-scandalised, half-amused,
murmuring to himself as the door closed something
about “funeral baked-meats,” which William set
down as a “bit o’ voolishness”.</p>

<p>He found Martha plunged in the most praiseworthy
grief, thereby much edifying the neighbours who had
gathered together to condole with her; but William, who
could only see the other aspect of the affair, immediately
beckoned her on one side and informed her of the step he
had taken.</p>

<p>“Lard!” cried she, genuinely taken aback, “whatever
made ye do that? Why, father ’ull only be buried o’
Thursday. You shouldn’t ha’ done it wi’out axin’ me.
’Tis too sudden. The folks ’ull say we’ve no decency.”</p>

<p>“Let ’em say what they like,” returned William firmly.
“I’ll keep to my ’greement, an’ I expect you to do the
same. ’Twas drawed out ten year ago an’ more. I’ve
stuck to my word, an’ you must stick to your’n.”</p>

<p>“’Twill be a very onconvenient time,” said Martha reflectively.
“Three-week come Monday—the middle of
August that’ll be, jist when we do take more money nor
any other month in the year.”</p>

<p>William cracked his finger joints one after another with
great decision, but made no verbal reply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>“There, I’ve a-been lookin’ forward to our honeymoon
all these years,” complained Martha, fresh tears rushing to
her eyes; “it’ll be a shame, I declare, if we have to give
it up! I’ve never took a holiday, no, not since mother died.
I don’t see how we can get away then, William.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care so much about gettin’ away,” said Faithfull
resolutely. “’Tis the weddin’ I do want. I’ll not have no
shilly-shally. I’ve a-told ye hundreds of times as I wouldn’t
wait a day longer nor I could help—an’ I won’t wait.
You’d best make up your mind to it.”</p>

<p>“Why, whatever’s come to ye?” cried Martha, really
angry. “’Tis downright indecent to go upsettin’ me like
this in the midst o’ my trouble. ’Tisn’t for you to be
namin’ the day either. Jist you keep a civil tongue in your
head, William, an’ have a bit o’ patience—maybe about
Michaelmas——”</p>

<p>“Michaelmas!” ejaculated the carpenter, catching up
his hat and fixing it firmly on his head. “I’ll tell you
summat, Martha—I’m goin’ to get married o’ Monday
three-week, whatever you mid be. If ye can’t make up
your mind to it there’s them as will. I’ll go warrant my
cousin Sabina, over to Sturminster, ’ud have me if I was
to ax her. Her an’ me was always very thick. Gully,
that’s her husband, left her very comfortable, an’ she has
but the one little maid.”</p>

<p>Martha thereupon came round in a twinkling, and flinging
herself into his arms, promised to agree to everything
he wished. A tender scene ensued, at the end of which
William suggested that he had better go upstairs to
measure the poor old man for his coffin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>When he came down again he found Martha in the
midst of her cronies, to whom she had imparted, with a
kind of regretful elation, the extreme pressure which
William had brought to bear upon her with regard to
their approaching nuptials, all her hearers being much impressed
and edified by the recital.</p>

<p>She turned to her lover as he was about to leave the
house:—</p>

<p>“Ye’ll not be chargin’ me nothin’, I shouldn’t think,” she
remarked with mournful archness.</p>

<p>William, who had not hitherto considered the matter,
hesitated for a moment, and then observed handsomely:—</p>

<p>“Nothin’ but the price of the wood, my dear. You
shall have the labour free.”</p>

<p>“Lard bless the man!” cried she, with some irritation.
“I believe he’s goin’ to make out a bill for it. Why, don’t
ye see, William, if we’re to be man an’ wife in three-week,
’twill be but takin’ the money out o’ one pocket to put it in
the other?”</p>

<p>“And that’s true,” agreed the friends in chorus.</p>

<p>After a pause, during which the carpenter had thoroughly
mastered the situation, he turned to his intended, and,
with a sudden burst of generosity, informed her that he
would make her a present of the whole thing.</p>

<p>“I haven’t gied you so very much afore now,” said he,
“but I’ll make you a present of this, my dear, an’ welcome.”</p>

<p>And he walked away, while Martha, looking after him
through her tears, observed that there wasn’t a better-natured
man in the whole of England.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>William, indeed, was in such good humour at the approaching
fruition of his hopes that Martha found him
more amenable than ever to her views.</p>

<p>Therefore, when, a day or two after the funeral, she
encountered him on his way to the tailor’s, where he intended,
as he informed her, to order his wedding-suit, she
was emboldened to lay her hand on his arm and beseech
him tearfully to be married, like her, in “deep”.</p>

<p>“’Twill show proper feelin’,” said she. “All the neighbours
’ull know that you are showin’ respect to poor father;
an’ since ye’ll be jist comin’ into the family, ’twill be but
decent as you should wear black for him what’s gone.”</p>

<p>William, who had been dreaming of a certain imposing
stripe which had dazzled him, days before, in the tailor’s
window, among the pile labelled “Elegant Trouserings,”
now dismissed with a sigh the alluring vision, and promised
to appear in mourning as requested.</p>

<p>But when later on Martha unfolded to him another
plan, he gave in his adherence to it with some reluctance.
It was no less a proposition than that they should take
their honeymoon by turns.</p>

<p>“You see,” she explained, “it just falls out that the
weddin’s the very week o’ the Branston show—the house
’ull be full from morn till night for three days or more; an’
we turn over enough that week to pay the year’s rent,
very near. ’Twouldn’t do for us both to be away.”</p>

<p>William gazed at her with a more rueful face than she
had ever yet beheld in him.</p>

<p>“Dear now! don’t you take on,” urged Martha. “I
thought, d’ye see, I’d just pop up to London for a few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
days by myself, an’ you can stop an’ mind the house, an’
maybe some time in the winter we mid both on us take a
few days together somewhere.”</p>

<p>William gazed at her reproachfully.</p>

<p>“Ye didn’t ought to want to go a-pleasurin’ wi’out I,”
said he.</p>

<p>“No more I would, my dear,” returned his future better-half,
“if it could be helped. But ’twas yourself as named
the day, an’ if ye won’t have it put off——”</p>

<p>The carpenter, with a vigorous shake of the head, intimated
that he certainly would not have it put off.</p>

<p>“Well, then,” summed up Martha triumphantly, “ye
must agree to let me have a bit o’ honeymoon. ’Tis what
every bride expects, an’ ’tis the one thought what have
kept my heart up all these years. I’ve always promised
myself this holiday afore I settled down to wedded life.”</p>

<p>William stared at her gloomily, but made no further
opposition; and she informed him in a cheerful tone that
he need not fear her staying away too long.</p>

<p>“We’ll have the weddin’ o’ Monday mornin’,” said she,
“quite private-like. The neighbours all know we can’t
have a great set-out here, on account o’ poor father. An’
you can carry my bag to the station directly we leave
church, an’ I’ll be back again Saturday night, so as we can
go to church together Sunday mornin’. Will that do ye?”</p>

<p>“’Twill have to do me, I s’pose,” returned William,
still with profound melancholy.</p>

<p>“’Tis by your own wish, ye know,” said the bride; “if
you hadn’t held out for us to be married all in such a
hurry, I’m sure I should have been glad for us to take our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
honeymoon together, my dear. But ye can’t have everythin’
in this world.”</p>

<p>“No,” agreed Faithfull, with a groan; “no, that ye
can’t. ’Twould ha’ been more nat’ral-like to go on our
honeymoon together; but what must be, must be.”</p>

<p>On the Monday morning the much-discussed wedding
took place; bride and bridegroom were alike clad in new
and glossy black, Martha’s blushing countenance being
scarcely visible beneath her crape “fall”.</p>

<p>The villagers were all much impressed; there is nothing
indeed that the rustic mind so thoroughly appreciates as
the panoply of woe, and to find this mourning ceremonial
united with marriage pomp was felt to be a rare privilege,
and, as such, productive of sincere admiration.</p>

<p>When the wedded pair left church, their friends and
neighbours hastened to offer congratulations, attuned to
a becoming note of dismalness, which intimated that condolence
lay behind; and it was a rude shock for all when
William was suddenly hailed in a tone of most discordant
cheerfulness. A tall, black-eyed woman had suddenly
rushed forward and seized him by the hand.</p>

<p>“There, now! So I wasn’t in time after all! I made
sure I’d get here soon enough to see the weddin’. I did
always say I’d come to your weddin’, didn’t I, William?
I thought it very unkind of ye not to ax me.”</p>

<p>“’Twas very private-like, d’ye see, Sabina,” said William,
who had been energetically pumping her hand up and
down. “Martha, here—I mean Miss Jesty, no, I mean
Mrs. Faithfull—she did want it private, along of her father
being dead.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>“Have ye been a-buryin’ of en to-day?” interrupted
the newcomer with an awe-struck glance at his sable garb.
“No, no—of course not. But why did ye go for to get
married in deep?”</p>

<p>“My ’usband,” said Martha repressively, “thought it
but right to show respect to them that’s gone, Mrs. Gully—I
think ye said your cousin’s name was Gully, William;
I s’pose this is your cousin?”</p>

<p>“’E-es, to be sure,” agreed the owner of that name,
cheerfully. “Half-cousin, if ye like it better—our mothers
was two brothers’ daughters.”</p>

<p>“Indeed,” said Martha stiffly. “I must wish ’ee good-day
now, for William an’ me be in a hurry to catch
train.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Gully’s jaw dropped, but the carpenter, after
hastily explaining that they weren’t having any party
along of the mourning, invited her to come home and
take a bite o’ summat with him and his wife before they
went to the station.</p>

<p>A frown from Martha intimated that she considered
this hospitality ill-timed, but William stuck to his point,
and they all three turned their steps together towards the
Pure Drop.</p>

<p>“I think I’ll hurry on an’ change my dress,” remarked
Martha, after stalking on for some moments in silence.</p>

<p>She was not going to travel in her best black and get
the crape all messed about with dust.</p>

<p>“Don’t mind me, William, my dear,” said Sabina, when
the bride had left them. “If you’re wanting to change
your deep, ye’d best hurry on, too, maybe.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>“I’ve no need to change my suit,” returned William
sorrowfully. “I bain’t a-goin’ on the honeymoon.”</p>

<p>“What!” cried the widow, in astonishment. “She’s
never goin’ to leave ye on your weddin’ day?”</p>

<p>“She be,” said Mr. Faithfull slowly. “It do seem a
bit hard, but we couldn’t both on us leave the house, an’
she haven’t a-had a holiday for twenty year. Ye see, it
fell out this way—”</p>

<p>And he proceeded to explain the circumstances, already
related, on which Mrs. Gully animadverted with
much warmth.</p>

<p>They were still discussing the matter when Martha
rejoined them in the private room of the Pure Drop,
where a slight refection had been set forth.</p>

<p>This was partaken of hastily, and for the most part in
silence, and at its conclusion Mrs. Faithfull jumped up
and took a ceremonious farewell of her new cousin. William
shouldered his wife’s bag and set forth beside her. Martha
beguiled the walk to the station by a variety of injunctions,
all of which the new landlord of the Pure Drop promised
to heed and obey. It was not until she had actually
taken her seat in the railway carriage that she found time
for sentiment, and then, embracing her husband, she expressed
the affectionate hope that he would not be lonely
during her absence.</p>

<p>William clambered out of the compartment and carefully
closed the door before he answered:—</p>

<p>“Well, I shan’t be altogether that lonely. Sabina—she
be a-comin’ to keep I company till ye come back.”</p>

<p>“Never!” cried Mrs. Faithfull, thrusting a scared face<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
out of the window. “You don’t mean to say ye took on
yerself to ax her to stop in my house?”</p>

<p>The whistle sounded at this juncture, but William
walked beside the train as it slowly moved off.</p>

<p>“I didn’t ax her. ’Twas she herself as did say, when
she heerd you were a-goin’ for to leave I all by mysel’,
says she, ‘I’ll tell ’ee what, Will’um; I’ll take a holiday,
too, an’——’” A loud and prolonged shriek from the
engine drowned the remainder of the sentence, and the
train steamed away, the last sign of the new-made bride
being the agitating waving of a protesting hand from the
carriage window.</p>

<p>The carpenter was smoking a ruminative pipe, about four
o’clock on that same afternoon, in the doorway of the snug
little hostelry of which he now found himself master, when
he was suddenly hailed by a distracted voice from the road.</p>

<p>“William! for the Lard’s sake, William, do ’ee come and
ketch hold of this here bag!”</p>

<p>William removed his pipe, stared, and then wedging the
stem firmly in the corner of his mouth, rushed down the
path and up the roadway.</p>

<p>“Bless me, Martha, be ye comed back again? Tired o’
London a’ready?”</p>

<p>“No, my dear, I didn’t ever get so far as London,” cried
Martha, thrusting the bag into his hand, and throwing herself
in a heated and exhausted condition upon his neck.
“I didn’t go no further than Templecombe. There, I’d
no sooner started nor I did feel all to once that I couldn’t
a-bear to leave ’ee. I fair busted out a-cryin’ in the train.”</p>

<p>“Did ye?” said Faithfull, much gratified.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>“I did indeed,” resumed his wife. “‘Oh,’ says I, ‘how
could I ever treat en so unfair,’ says I, ‘arter all them years
as him an’ me was a-walkin’? Oh,’ says I, ‘when I think
of his melancholy face, an’ this his weddin’ day an’ all.’ So
I nips out at Templecombe, an’ gets another ticket, an’
pops into the train as were just startin’ Branston-way—an’
here I be.”</p>

<p>“Well, an’ I be pure glad to see ye,” cried William
heartily.</p>

<p>They had by this time reached the house, and Mrs.
Faithfull, still breathless with fatigue and agitation, stared
anxiously about.</p>

<p>“Where is she?” she inquired in a whisper.</p>

<p>“Who?” said William, setting down the bag.</p>

<p>“Why, your Cousin Sabina!”</p>

<p>“Oh, her!” said William, with something like a twinkle
in his usually lack-lustre eye; “she be gone home-along to
fetch her things an’ lock up her house. She says she’ll
come back to-morrow mornin’ first thing.”</p>

<p>“Well, but we don’t want her now, do we?” cried
Martha, trembling with eagerness. “I was thinkin’ maybe
after all, ye’d fancy a bit of a holiday, William. Ye might
drop her a bit of a line an’ say ye was goin’ to take the
first honeymoon yerself. I fancy ye’d like London very
well, William. You <i>should</i> have the first turn, by right,
the man bein’ master; an’ I mid be able to run up for a
couple o’ days at the end o’ the week. Here’s my ticket,
d’ye see; you could catch the last train, you know, an’
then, as I tell ’ee, I’d come an’ j’ine ye.”</p>

<p>“That won’t do,” said William firmly; “nay, ’twon’t do.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>“Why not?” gasped Martha.</p>

<p>“Ye may pop that ticket in the fire,” said William,
speaking slowly, and suffering his countenance to relax
gradually. “’Tain’t no manner of use to I. I—be—a-goin’—for
to stop—an’ keep—my—honeymoon—here—along
of ’ee.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">OLF AND THE LITTLE MAID.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Olf</span> drove the cows up from their pasture by the river,
whistling all the way as was his wont. It was not a
particularly tuneful whistle, for he had no ear for music;
nevertheless, blending as it did with the morning ecstasies
of a particularly early lark, with the chirp of the newly
awakened nestlings in the rambling hedges, with the drone
of the first bee, with the thousand and one other sounds
of the summer dawn, these vacillating notes added something
to the general harmony. As his troop of cows
plodded tranquilly in front of him, they made green tracks
in the dewy sheen of the fields, the silvery uniformity of
which had hitherto been unbroken save for the print of Olf’s
own footsteps, large and far apart, where he had stridden
forth half an hour before to gather together his charges.</p>

<p>Arrived at the open gate, the cows passed solemnly
through, crossed the road and turned up the narrow lane
which led to Farmer Inkpen’s premises, made their way to
the shed at the farther end and took possession each of
her own stall.</p>

<p>The farmer had just emerged from the house, and was
in the act of tying the strings of his white “pinner”; his
wife and daughter, each carrying the necessary three-legged
stool, were walking slowly towards the scene of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
their morning labours. Another female form was already
ensconced on a similar stool at the very farthest end of the
shed, and edged itself a little sideways as the leading cow
stepped past it to her accustomed place. In a few minutes
the whole herd had ranged itself, and the rhythmical splash
of milk falling into the pails was soon heard.</p>

<p>According to custom, Olf’s next proceeding should have
been to “sarve” the pigs, but instead of directing his steps
towards the adjacent styes, he stood embracing one of the
posts which supported the shed, and gazing at his master
with a vague smile on his habitually foolish face.</p>

<p>“Well, Olf?” inquired the farmer, dropping his horny
fingers from the bow which he had just succeeded in tying
in the middle of his portly waist.</p>

<p>“Well, maister!”</p>

<p>The farmer glanced at him in amazement.</p>

<p>“Anything wrong?”</p>

<p>The smile on Olf’s face expanded into a grin. Clasping
the post still more firmly with one hand, he swung himself
round it to the full length of his arm, then swung himself
back again and became suddenly serious.</p>

<p>“Nay, sir, nay, there’s nothin’ wrong. I thought I mid
just so well show you this ’ere.”</p>

<p>Down went his hand into the depths of his pocket,
from which, after producing sundry articles of no particular
interest to any one but their owner, he drew forth a piece
of paper, folded small, and soiled with much fingering.
This he handed to his master, his face now preternaturally
solemn, his eyes round with an expression which might
almost be taken for one of awe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>Farmer Inkpen smoothed out this document and read
it, his jaw dropping with amazement when he had mastered
its contents. He stared at Olf, who stared back at him
with palpably increasing nervousness.</p>

<p>“Whatever is it?” cried Mrs. Inkpen, thrusting her
head round from behind the dappled flank of her particular
cow. “No bad noos, I hope.”</p>

<p>“Bad noos!” ejaculated her husband, recovering his
wits and his voice together, “what d’ye think? Olf there
has come into a fortun’!”</p>

<p>“Never!” exclaimed Mrs. Inkpen, craning her neck as
far as she could round her charge, but not ceasing for a
moment in her occupation. “You don’t say so!”</p>

<p>“However did ye manage that, Olf?” cried Annie Inkpen.
And the “spurt spurt” of the milk into <i>her</i> pail
ceased for a moment.</p>

<p>“’Tis a prize drawin’,” explained her father, speaking
for Olf, who was notoriously slow with his tongue.
“He’ve a-been an’ took a ticket in one o’ them Dutch
lotteries.”</p>

<p>“Four on ’em,” interrupted Olf, with unexpected promptitude.</p>

<p>“Eh?” inquired his master, turning round to look at
him.</p>

<p>“I say I did take four on ’em!” repeated Olf. “They
was a-talkin’ about it in the town, an’ they said two tickets
gave ye a better chance nor one, an’ four was the best of
all. So I did settle to take four.”</p>

<p>“Well, what have ye got? How much is the prize?”
cried the “missus,” now mightily excited, and feeling more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
at leisure to gratify her curiosity, as the time had come for
“stripping” her cow.</p>

<p>“A thousand pound, no less,” shouted her lord before
Olf could open his mouth. “Why, Olf’s as good as a
gentleman now. Lard, I never had the layin’ out of a
thousand pound in my life. Why, ye can take a bigger
farm nor this if ye do like, an’ ye can stock it straight off
wi’out being beholden to anybody.”</p>

<p>Olf, who had again been swinging himself round the post,
now paused to digest this astonishing piece of information.</p>

<p>Mrs. Inkpen cackled as she picked up her stool and
proceeded to operate on the next of the long row.</p>

<p>“Why, he’ll be settin’ up so grand as you please,” she
cried. “He’ll be gettin’ married first off, I should think.
Tain’t no use tryin’ to work a farm wi’out a missus.”</p>

<p>At this juncture light steps were heard pattering over
the cobble-stones, and Maggie Fry, from the village in
the “dip,” came up, jug in hand, to fetch the milk for her
father’s breakfast.</p>

<p>“What do you think?” shouted Annie, raising herself
a little from her seat in order to judge of the effect which
her announcement would produce upon Maggie, who was
a crony of hers. “What do you think, Maggie? Here’s
Olfred Boyt come into a fortun’. He’ve a-been an’ won
the thousand pound prize in one of them Dutch bank
drawin’s—he is a rich man this mornin’!”</p>

<p>“He is,” chimed in her mother, with a crow of laughter.
“I am just tellin’ him he’ll have to look out for a wife first
thing. Mr. Farmer Boyt must have a missus to look after
the grand noo property he be a-goin’ to buy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>“Ah, sure he will,” cried the farmer.</p>

<p>Olf swung himself round the post once more, and then
slowly regaining his former place, gazed thoughtfully at
Annie, whose fair, curly head was delicately outlined
against the golden-red flank of her cow.</p>

<p>“I’d as soon have you as any one, Annie,” he remarked
hesitatingly.</p>

<p>“Me!” cried Annie, jumping up and knocking over her
stool. “Of all the impudence! Me, Olf? Your master’s
daughter?”</p>

<p>Her pretty face was flushed to the temples, her eyes
were flashing fire. Her mother and father burst into loud
laughter, in which Maggie joined.</p>

<p>“I d’ ’low he isn’t very slack once he do make up his
mind,” cried the farmer, wiping his eyes. “’Tis a bit
strong, I will say, ’tis a bit strong, Olf.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be a master myself now,” explained Olf, looking
from one to the other, “an’ I’d as soon have Annie as
any one,” he added with conviction.</p>

<p>“Well, I’d a deal sooner not have you,” ejaculated
Annie, picking up her stool, and sitting down again with
a suddenness that betokened great perturbation of mind.
“I think ’tis most awful cheeky of you, Olf, to ask me,
an’ I don’t see as it is any laughing matter.”</p>

<p>Thereupon she fell to work again, the milk falling into
her pail in a jerky manner, which, while relieving her own
feeling, was not altogether satisfactory to her meek charge,
whose horned head came peering round as though to
ascertain the cause of this unusual disturbance.</p>

<p>Olf, after contemplating for a moment the resolute<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
outline of the back presented to him so decidedly, slowly
turned his gaze upon Maggie, who still stood by, laughing
and dangling her jug.</p>

<p>“Will you have me, Maggie?” he inquired pleasantly.</p>

<p>“Dear heart alive!” ejaculated the farmer, while his
wife once more gave utterance to a shout of laughter.</p>

<p>It was now Maggie’s turn to flush and look disconcerted.
“I’m not goin’ to put up wi’ Annie’s leavings,” she cried
indignantly. “The idea! I s’pose you reckon any maid
is to be picked up for the axin’, Olfred Boyt. You think
you have nothin’ more to do nor just p’int your finger at
the first one you fancy an’ she’ll have you straight off.
A pretty notion!”</p>

<p>“A pretty notion indeed,” cried Annie, “and a pretty
figure he’d be to go out a-coortin’!”</p>

<p>“’E-es,” resumed Maggie, with ever-increasing indignation,
“a pretty figure, I d’ ’low. Tell ye what, Olf, next
time you go a-coortin’ ye’d best wash your face first.”</p>

<p>“Ah! ’tis true. ’Twould be a good notion,” laughed the
farmer. “Ye bain’t exactly the kind o’ figure a maid ’ud
jump at.”</p>

<p>Olf raised a grimy hand to his sunburnt face as though
to ascertain what manner of appearance it presented. It
was true he had not washed it that morning, but there was
nothing surprising in that. It would indeed have been a
manifestly sinful waste of soap and water to perform one’s
ablutions before “sarving” the pigs. In fact, according to
established custom, Olf’s toilet was accomplished at a late
hour in the afternoon when his labours were concluded.
The condition of his chin would have at once announced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
to any experienced observer that it was then the middle of
the week; from the appearance of his garments he might
have recently effected a change with a tolerably respectable
scarecrow. Altogether, after a moment’s reflection, Olf
felt that Maggie’s point of view was justified, and that he
was not precisely the kind of figure to go courting at such
short notice. Presently he remarked reflectively, “Ah!
’tis true, I mid ’ave washed myself a bit afore axin’ the
question. I will next time.”</p>

<p>Then he held out his hand to the farmer for the paper,
pocketed it, and went shambling across the yard towards
the corner where the pig-bucket stood.</p>

<p>Except for the clatter of the cans, and the sound of the
spurting milk, silence reigned in the shed for a moment
after his departure. The farmer stood scratching his chin
meditatively, while the women-folk appeared also lost in
thought.</p>

<p>By-and-by Mrs. Inkpen’s voice sounded muffled from
behind her cow. “A thousand pound, mind ye, isn’t to
be picked up every day.”</p>

<p>“It bain’t,” cried her husband.</p>

<p>Annie tossed her head. “He be a regular sammy,” she
remarked.</p>

<p>“And ’tisn’t as if a maid hadn’t plenty of other chaps to
walk with,” chimed in Maggie.</p>

<p>From the farthest corner a little voice suddenly sounded,
“He be a very kind man, Olf be. He be a very kind man.”</p>

<p>“Do you think so, Kitty?” called out the farmer good-naturedly.
“Hark to the little maid! You think Olf be
a kind man, do ye, Kitty?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>“Don’t talk so much and mind your work, Kitty,” said
Mrs. Inkpen severely. “Nobody axed your opinion.
The idea,” she continued, in an angry undertone to her
husband, “of a little chit, the same as that, puttin’ in her
word. What does she know about Olf, or what kind of a
man he is? You will have to be lookin’ out for somebody
else to take Olf’s place, that’s what I’m thinkin’,” she
remarked presently to her husband. “’Tis a pity. Olf be
a bit of a sammy, as Annie do say, but he is a good worker
and never gives no trouble. I could wish somebody else
had won the fortun’.”</p>

<p>The two girls were now gossiping together and interchanging
various opinions derogatory to Olf, and eulogistic
of sundry other youths with whom it would appear
they “walked” by preference. By-and-by the milking was
concluded, and the farmer and his women-folk went in to
breakfast, Maggie having taken her departure some minutes
before.</p>

<p>As the cows began to troop pasturewards again, Olf,
standing by the yard-gate, noticed a girl’s figure come
darting forth from the obscurity of the shed. It was
Kitty, a workhouse-bred orphan, whom Mrs. Inkpen had
engaged as general help in house and dairy. She was a
little creature, small and slight, with a round freckled face
and flaming red hair. I say “flaming” advisedly, for it
seemed to give forth as well as to receive light. Her face,
habitually pink and white, was now extremely pink all over
as she paused opposite Olf; a dimple peeped in and out
near the corner of her mouth, and her teeth flashed in a
smile that was half-shy and half-mischievous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>“Please, Olf,” said she, “if you are lookin’ for a wife, I’m
willin’ to have ye.”</p>

<p>Olf, who had been about to pass through the gate in the
rear of his charges, wheeled about and faced her, scratching
his jaw meditatively.</p>

<p>“Oh, an’ are you, Kitty?” said he.</p>

<p>“E-es,” said Kitty, nodding emphatically.</p>

<p>Olf eyed her thoughtfully, and then his eyes reverted to
the cows, which, after the perverse manner of their kind,
were nibbling at the quickset hedge over the way.</p>

<p>“Who-ope, who-ope,” he called warningly, and then
once more glanced at Kitty. “We’ll talk about that ’ere
when I come back,” he remarked, and sauntered forth
pulling the rickety gate to after him.</p>

<p>Kitty paused a moment with a puzzled look, and then,
being a philosophical young person, picked up her pail
and betook herself indoors.</p>

<p>She had finished a somewhat perfunctory breakfast, and
was on her knees scrubbing the doorstep when Olf returned.
She heard his footfall crossing the yard, but did
not look round, neither did she glance up when his shadow
fell upon the sunlit flags. After the necessary pause for
adjustment of his ideas, Olf broke the silence.</p>

<p>“You’d be willin’ to take me?” said he.</p>

<p>“E-es,” returned Kitty, without raising her head.</p>

<p>Olf paused a moment, then—“You’d like to marry me,
would ye, Kitty?”</p>

<p>“E-es,” said Kitty again.</p>

<p>“They two other maids wouldn’t so much as look at
me,” pursued Olf, in a ruminative tone. “I wonder what
makes ye think you’d like to marry me, maidie?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>Kitty sat back upon her heels and contemplated him
gravely, mechanically soaping her scrubbing-brush the
while.</p>

<p>“You did carry my pail for I t’other day when ’twas too
heavy,” she replied presently, “and you did black my
shoes on Sunday when I was afraid I would be late for
church. And besides,” she added, “I think ’twould be
nice to get married, and there—I be so sick of scrubbin’
doorsteps and cleanin’ pots and pans!”</p>

<p>“That’s it, be it?” said Olf. “But you mid still have
to clean pots and pans after we was married, Kitty,” he
added with a provident eye to the future. “The missus,
she do often do a bit of cleanin’ up, if she be the
missus.”</p>

<p>“That would be different,” returned Kitty. “I shouldn’t
have no objections to scourin’ my own pots and pans.”</p>

<p>“True, true,” agreed Olf.</p>

<p>Kitty dropped on all-fours again. “Well, I have told
ye I’d be willin’,” she observed in somewhat ruffled tones,
“but of course ye needn’t if ye don’t like.”</p>

<p>“Who says I don’t like?” returned Olf, with unexpected
warmth. “I d’ ’low I do like. I do think it a very good
notion, my maid.”</p>

<p>Kitty gave a little unexpected giggle, and continued to
polish her doorstep with an immense deal of energy. Olf
stood by for a moment in silence. Then to her surprise,
and it must be owned, dismay, he turned about and walked
slowly away.</p>

<p>If Kitty had been unwilling to turn her head a few
moments before, no earthly power would have induced her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
to glance round at him now; she began to sing blithely and
carelessly to herself, and made a great clatter with her pail
and scrubbing-brush. Not such a clatter, however, but
that after a moment or two she detected the sound of
vigorous pumping on the opposite side of the yard, and
guessed, from certain subsequent sounds, that Olf was
washing his face.</p>

<p>Louder than ever sang Kitty when he presently crossed
the yard again and bent over her. But a wave of colour
rushed over her downcast face, and even dyed her little
white neck. She could hear Olf chuckling, and presently a
large finger, moist from recent ablutions, touched her chin.</p>

<p>“Look up a minute, my maid,” said Olf.</p>

<p>Kitty looked up. Olf’s sunburnt face was scarlet from
the result of his late exertions, and was imperfectly dried,
but it wore so frank and kindly a smile that the little maid
smiled back with absolute confidence.</p>

<p>“So we be to start a-coortin’, be we?” inquired Olf
pleasantly.</p>

<p>“I d’ ’low we be,” responded Kitty.</p>

<p>“How’s that for a beginnin’, then?” inquired Olf. And
thereupon he kissed her.</p>

<p>At this moment Mrs. Inkpen appeared on the threshold,
and soon her penetrating tones announced to the household
that Olf was at last suited with a bride. A good
deal of jesting and laughing ensued—not perhaps altogether
good-natured, for in some unaccountable way both
Mrs. Inkpen and Annie felt themselves slighted by this
sudden transfer of Olf’s affection—but the newly-engaged
couple submitted to their raillery with entire good humour,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
and presently resumed their interrupted vocations as
though nothing particular had taken place.</p>

<p>Towards evening, however, Olf found a moment for a
word with his little sweetheart.</p>

<p>“I be a-goin’ over to take this ’ere bit of writin’ to
the bank to-morrow,” said he. “Maister says ’tis the best
thing to do. He says they’ll keep it and give I money
when I do want it. I were a-thinkin’, Kitty, I mid make
ye a bit of a present—’tis all in the way o’ coortin’, bain’t
it? I wonder now what you’d like?”</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried Kitty, her eyes dancing with excitement,
“that’s real good o’ ye, Olf. I can’t call to mind as anybody
ever gave me a present. I do want a new hat
terrible bad.”</p>

<p>“A new hat,” repeated Olf, “that’s easy got. Wouldn’t
ye like summat a bit grander—a real handsome present?
What would you like best in the world, Kitty?”</p>

<p>“O-o-o-h!” cried Kitty again, and this time her eyes
became round with something that was almost awe.
“What I’d like best in the whole world, Olf, would be
to have a gold watch. I did dream once that I did have
a real gold watch o’ my own, and I never, never, never
thought that it mid come true. O-o-o-h! if I was to have
a gold watch!”</p>

<p>“Say no more, maidie,” exclaimed Olf, with doughty
resolution, “you shall have that there gold watch so sure
as my name be Olfred Boyt. There now! And you can
show it to Annie and Maggie Fry, and they can see for
theirselves what they mid ha’ had if they had been willin’
to take me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>Kitty pouted. “You don’t want to marry them now
you be a-goin’ to marry I, do ye?” she inquired pettishly.</p>

<p>“No more I do,” cried Olf, “but they mid ha’ been a
bit more civil.”</p>

<p>Kitty agreeing to this statement, harmony was at once
restored, and the pair parted with complete satisfaction.</p>

<p>Next day Olf duly conferred with his banker, and in
an extremely bad hand, and with difficulty, accomplished
the writing of his first cheque. It was for £5—a sum of
money which he had never in all his life hoped to possess
at one time. In fact, he was more elated at the sight of
the five golden sovereigns than he had been in contemplating
his thousand pound bond. He expended a certain
portion of this new wealth on his own personal adornment—having
his hair cut at a barber’s for the first time in his
existence, and investing in a new suit of clothes, the
pattern being a check of a somewhat startling description.
He also purchased a hat for Kitty with a wreath of blue
flowers, supplemented, at his particular request, by a white
feather.</p>

<p>“We do not generally use feathers with flowers,” expostulated
the shopwoman.</p>

<p>Olf considered. “I think I will have the feather all
the same,” said he; “feathers is more richer-like.”</p>

<p>“I did not want for to grudge ye nothin’, ye see,” he
subsequently explained to Kitty, “and this ’ere is the gold
watch.”</p>

<p>Kitty positively gasped with rapture. It was a very
fine watch certainly, extremely yellow, and with a little
diapered pattern on the case.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>“It cost thirty-five shillin’,” explained Olf, with modest
triumph. “’Tis rolled gold, so you may think how good
that must be.”</p>

<p>Kitty gasped again. Farmer Inkpen possessed a gold
watch of turnip shape and immense weight, but she felt
quite sure it was not rolled gold, and in consequence a
highly inferior article. She turned towards Olf with a
sudden movement and clasped both her little hands about
his arm—“I do like ye, Olf,” she said, “I do. I do think
ye be the kindest man that ever was made. I’ll work for
ye so hard as I can when I be your missus.”</p>

<p>There being no reason to delay the wedding, preparations
were made at once for that auspicious event. On
the following Sunday the banns were put up; Kitty and
Olf paid several visits to the upholsterer’s in the neighbouring
town and selected sundry articles of furniture, Olf
giving orders right and left in a lordly fashion which quite
dazzled his future bride. Farmer Inkpen made inquiries
with regard to a certain farm which he thought might
possibly suit his former assistant, and was moreover good
enough to promise help and advice in the selection of
stock. All, in fact, was proceeding merrily as that marriage
bell which they both so soon expected to hear, when there
came of a sudden a bolt from the blue. The manager
of the local bank sent a peremptory message one evening
to Olf requesting, or rather ordering, him to call without
delay.</p>

<p>The poor fellow obeyed the summons without alarm,
without even the faintest suspicion that anything was
wrong, and it was indeed with great difficulty that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
manager conveyed to him the astounding fact that the
precious bond, which was to have been the foundation of
his fortune, was so much waste paper; the prize-drawing
had been a swindling concern, and the thousand pound
prize did not exist.</p>

<p>“But I thought you told I that ’ere bit o’ paper <i>was</i>
a thousand pound,” expostulated Olf, when for the fortieth
time the manager had explained the state of the
case.</p>

<p>“That bit of paper represented a thousand pounds,”
returned that gentleman, with diminishing patience, “but
when we came to collect it, the money wasn’t there.”</p>

<p>Olf scratched his head and looked at him. “And what
be I to do now?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“Why, nothing, I am afraid. I don’t suppose you would
be able to prosecute, and even if you had the money to
carry on your case, it would not do you much good to
get those swindlers punished. You will just have to grin
and bear it, my poor fellow. We will give you time you
know—we won’t be hard with you.”</p>

<p>“Time?” ejaculated Olf, staring at him blankly.</p>

<p>“Yes. We have let you have £5 on account you know.
That will have to be paid back, of course, but we won’t
press you. You can let us have it little by little.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Olf, “thank ye,” and he went out, absently
stroking the check sleeve of the beautiful new suit which
had cost him so dear.</p>

<p>He shambled back to the farm and paused by the gate,
across which Mr. Inkpen was leaning.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Olf, back again?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>“’E-es,” said Olf, “I be back again, maister. Ye bain’t
suited yet, be ye?”</p>

<p>“Not yet,” said the farmer, “but ye can’t be married
afore another fortnight, can ye? I s’pose you’ll lend me a
hand until you shift?”</p>

<p>“I bain’t a-goin’ to shift. I bain’t a-goin’ to get wed,
I bain’t—” He paused, his lip trembling for a moment
piteously like a child’s. “It is all a mistake, maister—there
bain’t no money there.”</p>

<p>“Dear to be sure,” cried Farmer Inkpen.</p>

<p>Olf stood gazing at him. There was a dimness about
his eyes, and he bit his lips to stop their quivering.</p>

<p>Mr. Inkpen’s loud exclamation caused the women-folk
to appear on the scene, and in a moment the entire household
was assembled and plying Olf with questions.</p>

<p>“There is nothin’ more to tell ye,” he said at last. “’Tis
a mistake. There bain’t no money there—I can’t take no
farm. I must ax the folk o’ the shop to keep that ’ere
furniture and things—I haven’t made no fortun’, I be just
the same as I was ’afore, ’cept as I have a-got to pay back
a matter of £5 to the bank.”</p>

<p>Little Kitty stood by, growing red and pale in turn, and
fingering the watch in her waistband. All at once she
gave a loud sob and rushed away.</p>

<p>“Ah! she be like to feel it,” said the farmer, whose
heart was perhaps more tender than that of his wife or
daughter. “She’ll feel it, poor little maid. Sich a chance
for her—and now to go back to her scrubbin’ and cleanin’
just the same as ’afore.”</p>

<p>Olf heaved a deep sigh. “Well,” he said, “I’ll go home<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
and take off these ’ere clothes, and I’ll come back and
finish my work, maister.”</p>

<p>He then turned away, a very low-spirited and drooping
figure, his shoulders round under that astonishing plaid,
his head sunk almost on to his chest. After a little more
talk the family separated, Mrs. Inkpen feeling some irritation
on discovering that Kitty was nowhere to be found.</p>

<p>“She’s run off to cry,” said Annie. “However, don’t
ye take no notice of her for this once, mother; ’tis but
natural she should be a bit down, poor little maid.”</p>

<p>Olf had finished his work and was going dejectedly
homewards that night when, in the narrow lane which led
from the farm towards the village, he was waylaid by a
well-known figure. It was Kitty. Her eyes were filled
with tears, her face very pale, yet nevertheless there was a
note of triumph in her voice.</p>

<p>“I’ve been to the town, Olf,” she cried. “I didn’t want
ye to be at a loss through me, and the folks was kind.
They took back the watch all right and gave me the thirty-five
shillin’ for it. They wouldn’t take back the hat at the
shop where you got it, along ’o my wearin’ it you know.
They did tell me of a place where they buy second-hand
things, and they gave me seven shillin’ for it there. So
that won’t be so bad will it? You can pay that much to
the bank straight off.”</p>

<p>Olf looked at her dejectedly. “There, my maid,” cried
he. “I wish ye hadn’t done that. I could wish ye had
kept them two things what I did give ye—’twas all I could
do for ye. We can never do all we’d like to do now.”</p>

<p>Kitty sobbed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>“I take it very kind o’ ye to be so feelin’,” said Olf.
“I could wish we could have got wed, my maid. I’d ha’
been a lovin’ husband, and I d’ ’low you’d ha’ been a
lovin’ wife.”</p>

<p>“I would,” sobbed Kitty.</p>

<p>“But there, ’tis all over, bain’t it? I be nothin’ but a
poor chap earnin’ of a poor wage. You be a vitty maid
too good for the likes o’ me. I’ll never have a wife now.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see that,” said Kitty, in a low voice. She was
hanging her head and drawing patterns with the point of
her shoe in the sandy soil.</p>

<p>Olf stared at her, and then repeated his statement. “A
poor man earnin’ of a poor wage, Kitty. I’ll never have a
wife.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” said Kitty, almost inarticulately. “Many
poor men get wed, Olf.”</p>

<p>Olf caught his breath with a gasp. “Kitty,” he cried,
“Kitty, do ye mean you’d take me now wi’out no fortun’,
and just as I be? You’d never take me now, Kitty?”</p>

<p>“I would,” said Kitty, and she hid her face on his
patched shoulder and burst into tears.</p>

<p>“Then I don’t care about nothin’,” cried Olf valiantly.
“If you would really like it, Kitty, say no more.”</p>

<p>“I would,” said Kitty again. And then raising her
head, she smiled at him through her tears. “But don’t
tell nobody I axed ye,” said she.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">IN THE HEART OF THE GREEN.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the new keeper and his wife took possession of
their cottage, deep in the heart of Westbury Chase, summer
was still at its height. Jim Whittle’s real responsibilities
had not yet begun—a little breathing space was, as it were,
allotted to the young couple before settling thoroughly into
harness. So Betty thought at least, though Jim frequently
reminded her that summer was as anxious a time as any
other for a man in his position.</p>

<p>“What with folks expectin’ the young birds to be nigh
full-growed afore they was much more than hatched out;
and what wi’ the fear of there being too much wet, or too
much sun, and varmint an’ sich-like, I can tell ye, Betty,”
said he, “I’m as anxious in summer as in winter, very
near.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he found time to do many little odd jobs
for her which he could not have accomplished in the
shooting season: knocking together shelves, digging in
the garden, chopping up the store of wood which she
herself collected as she strolled out in her spare hours.
Betty was as happy as a bird in those days. Their new
home had been put in order before their advent, and was
spick and span from roof to threshold; the fresh thatch
glinted bravely through the heavy summer foliage; the
flowers in the little garden made patches of bright colour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
amid the surrounding green. Betty herself in her print
dress and with her hair shining like polished gold, Betty
carrying her six-months-old child poised on her round arm,
was an almost startling figure to those who came upon her
suddenly in the leafy aisles about her home. Brown and
grey and fawn and russet are the tones chiefly affected by
forest people; yet here were the mother and child, wood
creatures both of them, flaunting it in their pinks and
yellows before autumn had so much as crimsoned a leaf.</p>

<p>What wonder that the shy folk in fur or feather peered
at them with round astonished eyes, ere scuttling to cover
or taking to flight.</p>

<p>Dick Tuffin, the woodman, looked up in surprise from
the faggot he had just bound together, when Betty and
her baby-boy came towards him one sunny morning from
one of the many shadowy avenues which abutted on a
glade cleared by his own hands. As she advanced, he sat
back upon his heels amid the slender sappy victims of his
axe, and frankly stared at her.</p>

<p>He was a young man, dark as a gipsy, muscular and
lithe, with quick-glancing eyes and a flashing smile.</p>

<p>“Good-day,” said Betty, pausing civilly.</p>

<p>“Good-day to you, Mum. I d’ ’low you be new keeper’s
wife?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am Mrs. Whittle,” said Betty. “Are you cutting
down my husband’s woods?” she added, smiling.</p>

<p>“Ah! your husband’s woods ’ud not be in sich good
order as they do be if it wasn’t for I an’ sich as I,” returned
the man. “I do cut down a piece reg’lar every
year, an’ then the young growth comes, d’ye see, twice so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
thick as before, so that the game can find so much shelter
as they do like.”</p>

<p>“And what are you going to do with all these poor little
trees?” inquired Betty. “They are too green for firewood,
aren’t they?”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Dick, with his infectious smile, “I make
hurdles wi’ ’em for one thing, an’ some of ’em goes for
pea-sticks, an’ others is made into besoms. They mid be
green,” he added reflectively, “but folks do come here
often enough a-pickin’ up scroff for burnin’.”</p>

<p>Here the child on Betty’s arm began to whimper, and
she nodded to it and dandled it, her own person keeping
up a swaying, dancing movement the while.</p>

<p>Dick Tuffin watched her, at first with a smile; but presently
his face clouded.</p>

<p>“You have a better time of it, Mrs. Whittle,” said he,
“nor my poor little ’ooman at home. You do see your
husband so often as you like; but there, I must bide away
from home for weeks and months at a time. I mid almost
say I haven’t got a home; and Mary, she mid say she
haven’t got a husband.”</p>

<p>“How’s that?” inquired Betty, pausing, with the now
laughing child suspended in mid-air, to turn her astonished
face upon him.</p>

<p>“My place is nigh upon fifteen mile away from here. I
go travellin’ the country round, cuttin’ the woods and
makin’ hurdles; an’ ’tis too far to get back except for a
little spell now and then. I didn’t think o’ wedlock when
I took up the work, an’ now I d’ ’low I wouldn’t care to
turn to any other. But ’tis hard on the ’ooman.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>“She oughtn’t to let you do it!” cried the keeper’s wife
firmly. “Ha’ done, Jim; ha’ done, thou naughty boy!
I’ll throw thee over the trees in a minute!”</p>

<p>The child had clutched at her golden locks, pulling one
strand loose; she caught at the chubby hand, made believe to
slap it, and then kissed the little pink palm half a dozen times.</p>

<p>“Your wife ought to make you get your livin’ some
other way,” she added seriously.</p>

<p>“It couldn’t be done now,” said the woodman. “I have
done nothin’ but fell trees an’ plesh hurdles since I was
quite a little ’un. I couldn’t do naught else,” he added somewhat
dreamily; “I fancy I couldn’t bide anywhere except
in a wood.”</p>

<p>“Well, ’tis a fine life,” said she, willing to say something
civil.</p>

<p>“Yes, pleasant enough,” he agreed. “If I could tole my
missus about I’d never complain; but, there! it can’t be
done.”</p>

<p>He tossed the faggot on one side, and began to collect
materials for another. Betty noticed a great rent in his
fustian waistcoat, and, commenting upon the fact, volunteered
to mend it.</p>

<p>“’Tis awkward for ye having no one to sew for ye,” she
added, as Dick gratefully divested himself of the garment
in question.</p>

<p>“’Tis that,” agreed Tuffin. “I do move about so often
the folks where I lodge do never seem to take a bit of
interest in I. My wife, she do fair cry at times when she
do see the state my things be in. Come, I’ll hold the
youngster for ye, Mum.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>“Oh, he’ll be all right on the soft grass here!”</p>

<p>“Nay, I’d like to hold ’en if ye’ll let me. I want to get
my hand in, d’ye see. There’ll be a little un at our place
very soon.”</p>

<p>“I do call it unfeelin’ of ye to leave your wife alone
at such a time,” remarked Betty reprovingly.</p>

<p>“Her mother’s wi’ her,” returned Dick. “I’ll go home
for a bit in a fortnight or so, but I must be back in
October.”</p>

<p>He chirruped to the child, swinging him high in the air,
till Baby Jim crowed and laughed again. Soon Mrs.
Whittle’s task was accomplished, and she handed back the
waistcoat to its owner, receiving his profuse thanks in
return. As she walked away through the chequered light
and shade Dick looked after her.</p>

<p>“Some folks is luckier nor others,” he said. “Keeper
can live in the woods and have wife and child anigh him,
too; but I, if I be to live at all, must live alone.”</p>

<p>Then he thought of the little brown wife in that far-away
village, and wondered with a sudden tightening of
the heart-strings how she was getting on; but presently
he whistled again, in time to the rhythmic strokes of his
axe, as he pointed the sowels for his next lot of hurdles.</p>

<p>On the following morning when Betty was sweeping out
her house a shadow fell across the threshold, and, looking
up, she descried the woodman.</p>

<p>“I’ve brought ye a new besom,” said he, with a somewhat
shamefaced smile. “One good turn do deserve
another, Mrs. Whittle.”</p>

<p>“Thank ye kindly, I’m sure,” returned Betty, with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
bright smile. “I never thought of your making any
return for the few stitches I set for ye. The besom is a
beauty, Mr. Tuffin.”</p>

<p>“Glad ye like it,” said Dick, turning to take his leave.</p>

<p>“If ye’ve any other bits o’ mending, Mr. Tuffin,” Betty
called after him, “I’d be pleased to do ’em for ye.”</p>

<p>“Nay, now, I don’t like puttin’ too much on your good
nature, Mrs. Whittle,” said Dick, glancing over his shoulder
with a sheepish smile.</p>

<p>But the keeper’s wife insisted; and presently Dick confessed
that there were a good few socks lying by at his
lodgings in sore need of repair.</p>

<p>On the morrow he brought them, with the addition of a
large basket of “scroff,” or chips, for firing.</p>

<p>Keeper Jim was much amused at this exchange of
civilities; but was so far moved with compassion for
Tuffin’s lonely wife that he contributed a couple of nice
young rabbits to the little packet of comforts which Betty
sent her when Dick went home for his brief holiday; and
he was both touched and gratified when little Mrs. Tuffin
sent a return tribute of new-laid eggs and fresh vegetables
to the woman who had befriended her Dick.</p>

<p>Autumn came, scarcely perceptible at first in this sheltered
spot; little drifts of yellow leaves strewed Betty’s threshold
of a morning; there was a brave show of berries amid the
undergrowth; maple bushes lit cool fires here and there;
and travellers’ joy and bryony flung silver-spangled tendrils
or jewelled chains across a tangle of orange and crimson
and brown. The delicate tracery of twigs, the gnarled
strength of boughs, became ever more perceptible as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
leafage thinned; Jim could see more of the thatch of his
house as he tramped homewards, and could mark through
the jagged outline of the naked boughs how the blue
smoke-wreaths blew hither and thither as they issued from
his chimney.</p>

<p>There was a growing sense of excitement in the woods;
their silence was often broken by startled cries and the
whirring of great wings. Soon the glades would echo to
the sound of the beaters’ sticks; dry twigs would crack
beneath the sportsmen’s feet; shots would wake the slumbering
echoes; and then a cart would come and bear away
the rigid bodies erstwhile so blithe. Betty almost cried as
she thought of the fate that awaited the pretty birds
which she had so often fed with her own hand and which
the baby had loved to watch; but Jim chid her when she
said she hoped many of them would escape.</p>

<p>“Tell ’ee what,” he remarked sternly, “if the gentry
don’t find more pheasants nor in the wold chap’s time
they’ll say I bain’t worth my salt. There, what be making
such a fuss about? ’Tis what they be brought up for. D’ye
think folks ’ud want to be watchin’ ’em an’ feedin’ ’em an’
lookin’ arter ’em always if ’twasn’t that they mid get shot
in the end? They must die some way, d’ye see; and I d’
’low if ye was to ax ’em, they pheasants ’ud liefer come
rocketin’ down wi’ a dose o’ lead in their innards nor die
natural-like by freezin’ or starvin’ or weasels or sich.”</p>

<p>Jim grew more and more enthusiastic as the time drew
nearer for the big shoot, which was, as he expected, to
establish his reputation. This was not to take place till
late in November, so as to allow time for the trees to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
fully denuded of their leaves. The keeper often talked
darkly of the iniquities of certain village ne’er-do-weels,
who, according to him, thought no more of snaring a
rabbit than of lying down in their beds.</p>

<p>“If they only kept to rabbits,” he added once, “it
wouldn’t be so bad; but when those chaps gets a footin’ in
these woods there’s no knowin’ where they’ll stop. But
they’ll find I ready for them. They’ll find I bain’t so easy
to deal wi’ as wold Jenkins.”</p>

<p>“Dear, to be sure, Jim, I wish you wouldn’t talk so!”
said Betty. “You make me go all of a tremble! I shall
be afeard to stop here by myself when you’re away on your
beat if you ’fray me wi’ such tales. I don’t like to think
there’s poachin’ folk about.”</p>

<p>“There, they’d never want to do nothin’ to a woman,”
said Jim consolingly; “’tis the game they’re arter. They’ll
not come anigh the house, bless ye!”</p>

<p>“Well, but I don’t like to think they mid go fightin’
you,” she whimpered.</p>

<p>Jim bestowed a sounding kiss on her smooth cheek.</p>

<p>“Don’t ye fret yoursel’,” he cried; “they’ll run away
fast enough when they do see I comin’. Why, what a
little foolish ’ooman thou be’est! There, give over cryin’.
I didn’t ought to ha’ talked about such things.”</p>

<p>Betty’s pretty eyes were still somewhat pink, however,
as she came strolling into Dick’s quarters that afternoon;
and her lip drooped when in answer to his questions she
divulged the cause.</p>

<p>“Afeard o’ poachers!” exclaimed the woodman, with a
laugh. “Bless ye, Mrs. Whittle, poachers bain’t no worse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
nor other folks! Dalled if I can see much harm in a man
catchin’ a rabbit or two when there’s such a-many of ’em
about! The place be fair swarmin’ wi’ ’em o’ nights.”</p>

<p>Betty was much shocked; and returned reprovingly that
it couldn’t ever be right to steal. “And poachin’ is but
stealin’,” she summed up severely.</p>

<p>“Stealin’!” echoed Dick; “nay, ye’ll never make me
believe that. I d’ ’low the Lard did make they little wild
things for the poor so well as for the rich. Pheasants, now,”
he continued, ruminating, “I won’t say as any one has a right
to take pheasants except the man what owns the woods.
I’d as soon rob a hen-roost, for my part, as go arter one o’
they fat tame things as mid be chicken for all the spirit
what’s in ’em. I’d never ax to interfere wi’ a pheasant,”
he continued reflectively, “wi’out it was jist for the fun o’
the thing. But settin’ a gin or two—wi’ all these hundreds
and thousands o’ rabbits runnin’ under a body’s feet—ye’ll
never make me think there’s a bit o’ harm in it.”</p>

<p>“Don’t let my husband hear such talk!” said Betty
loftily.</p>

<p>The woodman laughed again. “I wouldn’t mind
speakin’ out plain to his face,” said he. “Him and me
is the best o’ friends—I do like en very well,” continued
Dick handsomely; “better nor I ever thought to like a
gamekeeper. As a rule, I don’t hold with folks what goes
spyin’ about, a-tryin’ to catch other folks in the wrong.
I never could a-bear a policeman, now—’tis my belief they
do more harm than good.”</p>

<p>“Gracious!” ejaculated the scandalised Betty. “I don’t
know how you can go for to say such things.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>“Well, d’ye see, ’tis this way,” explained Dick. “If a
man do want for to get drunk, drunk he’ll get if there
be farty policemen arter him. If he’s willin’ to make a
beast of hisself, and to ruin his wife and family, and to
get out o’ work an’ everything, for the sake of a drap o’
drink, ’tisn’t a policeman that ’ull stop him. And if a chap
do want to fight another chap—his blood being up, d’ye
see—he’ll fight en—ah, that he will! and give no thought
at all to the chance o’ bein’ run in for it. And jist same
way—if a body has a notion to trap a rabbit, trap it he
will, keeper or no keeper.”</p>

<p>Here Dick selected a sapling and began to trim it
leisurely, pursing up his lips the while in a silent whistle.</p>

<p>“I’ll not tell Whittle all you’ve said,” remarked Betty
with dignity, as she shifted her baby from one arm to the
other, and prepared to walk on. “He mid think you was
a poacher yourself.”</p>

<p>“You may tell him if you like,” retorted Dick, and then
he whistled out loud and clapped his hands at the baby,
which thereupon laughed ecstatically, and almost sprang
from its mother’s arms. The keeper’s wife relaxed, and
mentally resolved to make no allusion to Dick’s unorthodox
sentiments in conversing with her husband. Jim himself
had said that it wouldn’t be so bad if folks only kept to
rabbits, and Dick had intimated that he would never care
to touch anything else. A body should not be too hard,
she reflected, on a poor fellow who had no home, so to
speak; why, he was almost like a wild creature of the
woods himself, living out in all weathers, sleeping often
under the stars, picking up a chance meal as he best could—there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
was no great wonder if he had become as lawless
as the four-footed “varmint” against whom the keepers
waged such fierce war.</p>

<p>One evening, shortly before the great shoot was to take
place, Jim came home to tea in a state of contained excitement.
When the meal was over he went to the door, and
began, to his wife’s surprise, to examine the fastenings
carefully.</p>

<p>“’Tis a good stout bolt,” he remarked, “and the lock
be a new ’un. I d’ ’low if house was shut up you wouldn’t
be afeard to bide alone in it?”</p>

<p>Betty immediately demonstrated the presence of mind
which she would be likely to display under such circumstances
by uttering a loud scream.</p>

<p>“Oh, Jim, Jim!” she cried, “why be goin’ to stop out
all night? I do know so well as if you did tell me that
you be goin’ into danger.”</p>

<p>“Danger!” cried the keeper, thumping his great chest,
“not much fear o’ that! There, don’t ye be so foolish.
Me and Stubbs be a-goin’ over t’other side o’ the park
down to the river to see to that ’ere decoy for duck, as
squire be so set on puttin’ to rights. ’Tis five mile away;
we be like to be kep’ late, very late—till daybreak, most
like; but do you make the house fast, old ’ooman, and no
harm ’ull come to either of us.”</p>

<p>Had Betty not been so much absorbed in the main issue,
she might have detected something improbable about the
keeper’s story; but, as it was, her fears for him were almost
lost in the horror of being left all night alone in that desolate
spot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>Jim, however, jested at her terrors, and himself made the
round of the cottage, fastening the casements and securing
the seldom-used front door. He stood outside the threshold
while she drew the bolts and locked the back one.</p>

<p>“Get to thy bed early,” he called to her. “Go to sleep
so fast as thou can; and first thing thou knows thou’lt hear
me knockin’ to be let in.”</p>

<p>But somebody else knocked before Betty had any
thought of going to bed; before, indeed, she had finished
washing up the tea-things.</p>

<p>“Who’s that?” cried she, thrusting a scared face out of
the window.</p>

<p>“It’s me, Mrs. Whittle—Dick Tuffin. I’ve a-brought ye
back your hamper what I promised to mend for ye. Why,
ye be shut up very early, bain’t ye?”</p>

<p>“Whittle’s gone travellin’ off a long way,” she answered
with a scarcely perceptible sob. “There, he be gone
to the river—’tis a good five mile off, he do say. I’m
frightened to death here by myself.”</p>

<p>She heard him laugh in the darkness.</p>

<p>“How ’ud ye like to be my little wife,” he asked, “as
bides alone night after night, wi’ nobody but the little ’un,
now her mother have a-left her? I wouldn’t be afeard,
Mrs. Whittle. Your house be so safe as a church; and
there’s Duke—he’s big enough and strong enough to guard
ye. Hark to en barkin’ now, the minute he do hear my
voice!”</p>

<p>“Well, and that’s true,” agreed Betty in a more cheerful
tone. “Thank ye for mendin’ the hamper, Mr. Tuffin.
I’ll open the door in a minute.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>“No, don’t ye bother to do that,” said Dick. “The
hamper’ll take no harm out here till morning. Good-night
to ye.”</p>

<p>“Good-night,” said Betty, closing the window.</p>

<p>She heard the sound of his footsteps die away, and then
the loneliness of the forest night seemed to close in upon
her. Jim had often been out as late as this, and later,
but the mere knowledge that he did not intend to return
till daybreak made her more nervous than she had ever
been. When the logs crackled or fell together she started
violently; the moaning of the wind in the branches without
filled her with dread, though often, when she and her
husband sat by the hearth, they had declared the sound
made them feel more snug. More than once she opened
the window and listened; a fine, close rain was falling,
making a dull patter upon the thatched roof, dripping from
the eves; but besides these sounds there were many others,
strange, unaccountable, terrifying—creakings and crackings
of boughs; now what seemed to be a stealthy tread, now
whispering voices. She chid herself for these fancies,
knowing well that they must be without foundation, since
Duke remained silent; nevertheless her flesh crept and
the dew of terror started to her brow.</p>

<p>At length, making a strong resolution, she went up to
her attic bedchamber, undressed, and, taking the child
into her arms, crept into bed. But she lay there for a
long time, quaking, and staring with wide-open eyes into
the darkness; until, overcome by sheer fatigue after a long
and busy day, she fell asleep.</p>

<p>She woke up suddenly, and sat for a moment vainly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
endeavouring to disentangle the confusion of sound which
filled her ears. Her heart was beating like a drum, the
blood surged in her brain—a dream-panic was still upon
her, and yet there were certain other unmistakable noises
to be heard without. Duke was barking in frenzied fashion
and straining at his chain; men were shouting at no very
great distance, and now—what was that? A single shot!</p>

<p>“It’s the poachers!” exclaimed Betty, with chattering
teeth. “Pray God they don’t come here!”</p>

<p>In the midst of her anguish of fear she felt a sudden
rush of gratitude. Jim was safe out of the way, thanks
be! Jim would not be back till the folks had got off with
their spoil. But now Duke was whimpering and crying in
a most eerie and heartrending manner, and presently uplifted
his voice in long-drawn howls which jarred upon
Betty’s overwrought nerves beyond endurance. She
jumped out of bed and ran to the casement. It had
ceased raining, and though the moon rode between piles
of angry clouds, she sent forth at that moment an extraordinarily
clear light. Betty could see the skeleton branches
of the trees all wet and shining as they tossed against the
sky; the little paved path glimmered white; yonder stood
a dark patch—Dick’s hamper. She could see Duke pacing
round and round his kennel, at the utmost length of his
chain; now sniffing the ground, now lifting up his head
for another howl.</p>

<p>She rapped at the pane and called to him sharply; and
the dog looked up at her window, and suddenly wheeled
in the opposite direction, pricking his ears.</p>

<p>Steps were heard approaching—slow, lagging steps—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
presently two figures came staggering together out of
the wood. Betty screamed as they emerged from the
shadow, and then leaned forth, paralysed with dread; for
as the two slowly advanced into the moonlit path she
recognised Stubbs, the under-keeper, and saw that he was
supporting, almost carrying, his companion.</p>

<p>“Be that you, Mrs. Whittle?” cried Stubbs. “Come
down, Mum, come down this minute! This be a bad
night’s work!”</p>

<p>The man leaning upon him raised his head with an
inarticulate attempt to speak, and Betty saw that it was
Jim—her own Jim—her husband! But, oh! what tale
was that told by the drawn features and glassy eyes?</p>

<p>She had screamed at the unknown terror, but she uttered
no sound now. Before they reached the door she had
mechanically thrown on her dress over her nightgown, and
had come downstairs, pattering with her bare feet. She
flung open the door, and put her arms round her husband,
almost as if she grudged him any support but hers.</p>

<p>“My poor little ’ooman!” said Jim brokenly; “I d’
’low I’m done for.”</p>

<p>With Stubbs’ aid she stretched him on the sofa, and
unfastened coat and waistcoat. She drew out her hand
from his bosom suddenly, and looked at it with a shudder:
it was red!</p>

<p>“Ah, he’s got the whole charge in en somewhere,”
groaned Stubbs. “There was a lot of ’em out to-night,
and we catched one of ’em; he fought like a devil, he did—’twas
in wrestling wi’ him poor Whittle’s gun went off.
Dear to be sure, ’tis awful to think on. His own gun!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>“Where’s the man?” asked Betty sharply; her face was
as white as a sheet—her lips drawn back from her gleaming
teeth.</p>

<p>“Oh, he made off, ye mid be sure,” returned the other.
“I don’t know who he was. ’Twas in the thick o’ the
trees yonder we come on ’em. Moon had gone in and
’twas as dark as pitch.”</p>

<p>“Do you think my husband will die!” gasped Betty.</p>

<p>“Ah! ’tis a bad job—’tis surely,” responded the other,
almost whimpering; “and the worst on’t is we be nigh six
mile from a doctor.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Stubbs,” cried the keeper’s wife earnestly,
“let’s do everything we can, any way! Will ye go for
the doctor for me? Do! I’ll—I’ll give ye every penny
in the house if ye will!”</p>

<p>“Lard! my dear ’ooman, I don’t want no pay for doin’
what I can at sich a time. I’ll go, to be sure, an’ make so
much haste as I can; but—won’t ye be afeard to bide
here all alone—and him so bad?”</p>

<p>Betty saw that he expected her husband would die
before his return, but she did not flinch.</p>

<p>“I will do anything in the world so long as there’s a
chance of saving him!” she cried. “Run, Mr. Stubbs,
run! Make haste—oh, do make haste!”</p>

<p>Stubbs drew his arm from beneath the wounded man’s
shoulder, and hastened away without another word. Betty
went to her linen-drawer, and found an old sheet, which
she tied round Jim’s body to staunch the bleeding; he
seemed to have received the charge chiefly in his right<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
side. He opened his eyes and smiled at her faintly, and
then she dropped on her knees beside him.</p>

<p>“Jim,” she whispered, “you never went away arter all?”</p>

<p>He shook his head feebly. “I meant it for the best,”
he said; “I heard these chaps would be up to their tricks
to-night, and I thought me and Stubbs ’ud catch them.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Jim,” said Betty, “ye told me a lie!”</p>

<p>“I meant it for the best, my dear,” he returned faintly.
“I didn’t want ye to be frayed—poor little ’ooman! Ye
mustn’t be vexed.”</p>

<p>Betty stooped and kissed him, and he closed his eyes.</p>

<p>“I reckon I’m goin’,” he said. “Well, I done my dooty.
But what ’ull ye do, my dear?”</p>

<p>“I’ll manage,” said Betty.</p>

<p>Her voice had a harsh note quite unlike its own; she
sank down in a heap on the floor, staring before her. She
knew what she would do if Jim died. She would first of
all find the man who had killed him, and then—oh, he
should pay for it!</p>

<p>Jim had fallen into a kind of drowsy state, and presently
his hand slipped down and unconsciously touched hers: it
was very cold. Betty, rousing herself, went towards the
hearth, drawing the embers together. There was not
enough fuel, however, to make much of a fire; and, softly
opening the door, she went out to the woodshed, her bare
feet making no sound on the damp stones. As she was
returning with her burden the wicket-gate swung open,
and Dick Tuffin come up the path.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Whittle! Mrs. Whittle!” he called pantingly.</p>

<p>She turned and confronted him. The moon had dipped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
behind the trees and she could not distinguish his face, but
something in the aspect of the man struck her with a
lightning-like intuition.</p>

<p>“Come in,” she said hoarsely.</p>

<p>Dick followed her into the house, starting back at sight
of the prostrate figure on the couch. Betty dropped her
wood on the hearth and came swiftly across to him with
her panther-like tread. There was an expression on her
face which might have recalled the beast in question. She
placed both her hands upon his breast, and he, giving way
before them, stepped backwards a few paces.</p>

<p>“Look at him,” said Betty; “he is dying! Dick
Tuffin, it is you who have killed my husband!”</p>

<p>“I swear I didn’t know it was him,” faltered Dick.
“I’d no thought of harm. I went out with the others for
a frolic. You yourself did tell I your husband was miles
away.”</p>

<p>She had told him! He would make out that she had
delivered him into their hands! A red mist came before
her eyes.</p>

<p>“Even when he did catch I,” went on Dick, “I didn’t
know who ’twas. But somebody told me jist now that
Stubbs was runnin’ for the doctor for en, so I come—I
couldn’t rest, ye see. I had to come. Mrs. Whittle, I
don’t know what you’ll say to me.”</p>

<p>Betty said nothing at all, but the steady pressure of her
hands upon his breast increased, and, as before, Dick recoiled
beneath it. Her eyes were blazing in her white
face; her dishevelled fair hair fell about her shoulders.
Dick gazed at her remorsefully, suffering her unresistingly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
to push him the length of the little room and through an
open doorway. He imagined her to be ejecting him from
the house, but all in a moment she threw her whole weight
upon him with such violence that he stumbled and fell.
Before he could recover he found the door closed upon
him and bolted. He heard hasty steps in the inner room
and the dragging across the floor of some heavy piece of
furniture, which was presently pushed against the door.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Whittle!” he called out, “what are you doing?
Are you mad?”</p>

<p>Then came Betty’s voice, harsh and broken: “I’ve got
ye, Dick Tuffin! Ye can’t get out; there’s no window
and no other door. I’ve got ye and I mean to keep ye!
Ye’ve killed my husband—ye’ve made me a widow and
my child an orphan—an’ I’ll not rest till I do the same by
your wife and your child.”</p>

<p>And then something else came battering up against the
door. Dick had no doubt but that the barricade was now
complete. He felt about him in the darkness, identifying
shelves, one or two small barrels, a crock: he was in the
buttery most likely. He might possibly force his way out;
the bolt was in all probability not very strong, and once
the door was opened he could soon do away with all other
obstacles; but then he would have that fierce woman to
encounter. He could not escape without doing her some
hurt, and the awful face of the wounded man would again
meet his gaze. Besides, of what use would it be to attempt
to escape? He was well known in the place, and the
police would soon track him.</p>

<p>He sat down, therefore, with the resignation of despair,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
shivering from time to time, and straining his ears for
every sound in the next room. He heard poor Jim groan
now and then, and Betty speak to him in a voice of such
yearning tenderness that it was scarcely recognisable as the
same which had threatened himself a little while before.
He thought of Betty as she had first come upon him, so
young and gay in her pink dress, and with her yellow hair
glancing in the sun, and of the child which he had so often
dandled in his arms. Widow and orphan! Widow and
orphan! And all because Dick Tuffin had gone out with
a few idle chaps for a night’s frolic. And then he thought
of his own little woman at home: he seemed to see her in
her “deep”. And the little one, who would never be able
to hold up his head because they hanged his father.</p>

<p>Thus did he muse very sorrowfully until slumber overtook
him in that inexplicable fashion with which it will
sometimes come upon the weary and anxious of heart.
And he slept until the grey light of morning began to
creep through the chinks of the barricaded door.</p>

<p>He heard voices in the adjoining room—men’s voices,
and Betty’s; then the tread of feet walking in unison.
The little stairs creaked; the heavy footfalls now tramped
in the room overhead, then descended again, and crossed
the kitchen. Now the folks were leaving the house; he
could hear them clattering down the path, and caught the
swing of the gate.</p>

<p>“It’s all over,” he said to himself, “they’ve carried the
poor chap upstairs.”</p>

<p>A sudden numbness came upon him: it was true, then,
and not a bad dream. Poor Jim Whittle was dead, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
he, Dick, had killed him; and now Betty would give him
up to the police, and he would be tried and convicted and
hanged.</p>

<p>Dick was not very learned in the statutes of his country,
and had no manner of doubt that since the keeper had
been killed in struggling with him—by his hand, it might
be said, for the gun had gone off owing to Dick’s endeavour
to wrench it away—he would have to pay the full
penalty of the law. To be hanged by the neck until he
was dead. He put his hand to his throat, and drew a long
sobbing breath.</p>

<p>After what seemed an interminable time, he heard once
more the sound of voices in the kitchen—a man’s voice
and Betty’s—then a quick firm step crossing the room to
the house-door, and finally the retreating sounds of a
horse’s feet. Then there was a scraping and bumping of
furniture; the rim of light which had been perceptible but
half-way down the door suddenly lengthened, the bolt
grated in its hasps, and in another moment Betty stood
before him.</p>

<p>Dick had been so long imprisoned in the darkness that
at first he could hardly bear the flood of wintry light
which burst upon him. And there, in the midst of it, was
the woman, with so bright a face that he could scarce
credit his eyes. She stretched out both hands to him and
cried:—</p>

<p>“He be to live! Doctor says he be to live!” Her
voice faltered and broke, the tears leaped from her eyes.
“Thank God!” she cried. “Oh, thank God! He’ll live!
My Jim’s to live!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>Dick came staggering forth from his cell. His brown
face was blanched to a sickly pallor; he trembled in every
limb. Choking back her sobs, Betty again extended her
hand to him, and he wrung it; but, turning from her, he
leaned against the wall, hiding his face. His shoulders
were heaving.</p>

<p>“Doctor says he’ll not die,” pursued Betty betwixt
laughing and crying. “He’s young and strong, he says,
and he’ll get over it. ‘We’ll get as much lead as we can
out of him,’ says doctor, ‘and he’ll carry the rest quite
comfortable, as many another has done before him.’”</p>

<p>She laughed a feeble, wavering laugh that ended in a
sob. “He said we’d best get him upstairs and put him to
bed,” continued Betty. “Stubbs and another man come
up from the village, so they carried him up; and doctor’s
been with him a long time, and he’s sleepin’ now.”</p>

<p>She told her tale brokenly, with a little gasp between
each word; but Dick made no comment. Presently he
turned round again, his face still working.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Whittle,” he said unsteadily, “I’d like ye to hear
me say so solemn as I can, as I’ll never lay another finger
on any creature in the woods. I’ll never touch another
feather——”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s all right, it’s all right!” interrupted she quickly.
“I’d like ye to hear <i>me</i> say summat too. I was mad last
night, but I bain’t so hard-hearted as I made out. Even
if my Jim had died I wouldn’t never ha’—I wouldn’t ha’
made a widow of your poor wife, nor yet an orphan o’ the
baby.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE WOLD STOCKIN’.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Farmer Hunt</span> stood leaning over his farmyard gate with
the reflective, and at the same time pleasantly expectant,
expression of the man who awaits at any moment a
summons to dinner. To him, picking her steps cautiously
down the muddy lane which led to his premises, came old
Becky Melmouth, her skirts tilted high and an empty
basket on her arm. Farmer Hunt nodded at her good-humouredly,
and hailed her as soon as she was within
hearing.</p>

<p>“What!” cried he. “Have ye brought me another of
’em?”</p>

<p>“I’ve a-brought ye two,” returned Becky triumphantly.
“But maybe you’re too busy to attend to me just now,”
she added, with a glance that was half apologetic and half
appealing.</p>

<p>“Oh, I can spare a minute for that,” said the farmer
good-naturedly. “Brewery hooter’s not gone yet, and we
don’t have dinner till one. Step in, Mrs. Melmouth.”</p>

<p>He preceded her into the house, and led the way to a
small parlour, empty save for a large yellow cat which lay
curled up on the hearthrug. With a mysterious air which
assorted with the cautious glance thrown round by Becky
as she closed the door, he proceeded to unlock a large oak<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
chest, and thrusting in his hand, drew forth a faded
worsted stocking. As he handed this to the old woman
the contents chinked with a portentous sound. Mrs.
Melmouth’s eyes glistened, and her rosy wrinkled face
wreathed itself with smiles, as she slowly undid the knot
at the upper end, and thrust in her hand. A further
chinking sound ensued, and she looked jubilantly up at
the farmer.</p>

<p>“There be a lot on ’em now,” she remarked.</p>

<p>“Ah, sure!” he agreed. “An’ you be bringin’ two
shillin’ more, you do say?”</p>

<p>“Two shillin’ an’ a thruppenny bit,” corrected Becky
gleefully. “I be doin’ uncommon well wi’ my eggs an’
chicken jist now.”</p>

<p>“Dear heart alive! Keep the thruppence, ’ooman!”
cried Mr. Hunt, with a certain amount of impatience. “It
’ull maybe buy you a relish of some sort as ’ull make ye
fancy your victuals more. I reckon you do scrimp too
much.”</p>

<p>Becky pursed up her lips and shook her head.</p>

<p>“I’d sooner save it,” said she. “Can I have the book,
sir.”</p>

<p>“Ah, sure ye can,” returned the farmer, and, after
rummaging a moment in the chest, he produced a small
account-book with a pencil attached to it by means of a
much-worn bit of string.</p>

<p>Becky meanwhile had been fumbling for her spectacles,
and having now assumed them, she proceeded to enter
the sum she had so proudly mentioned, to her banking
account.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>“How much does that make?” she added, peering up
at Mr. Hunt through her glasses; her toothless gums
parted in a smile which was already rapturous.</p>

<p>“Let me see,” returned he, taking the book from her
hand; “last time I reckoned it up there was forty pound
in it, an’ you’ve a-been here twice since—and again to-day.
You’ve got in that there wold stockin’, Mrs. Melmouth,
forty pound four shillin’ an’ ninepence. It do do ye credit,”
he added handsomely; “ah! that it do. ’Tisn’t many a
hard-workin’ body same as yourself would put by half so
much. Ye’ve put in over nine pound since I took charge
of it for ye.”</p>

<p>“An’ that’s ten year ago come Michaelmas,” said Becky,
with modest pride. “But Melmouth an’ me had been
savin’ for thirty year afore that.”</p>

<p>“An’ you yourself ’ull go on savin’ for another thirty
year, I shouldn’t wonder,” said Mr. Hunt, with a jovial
laugh. “There ye be so strong upon your legs as ever
you was, an’ never sick nor sorry, be ye?”</p>

<p>“Well, not to speak on, thanks be,” responded Becky.
“But I could feel a deal easier-like in my mind if I could
settle who it’s all to go to when I be gone. I be puzzled
what to do—ah! that I be. Thicky wold stockin’ do lay
upon my heart jist same as a lump o’ lead.”</p>

<p>“It didn’t ought to be such a trouble to ye,” said Mr.
Hunt. “Divide it, Mrs. Melmouth. Divide it fair and
square among your nevvies and nieces.”</p>

<p>“No,” cried Mrs. Melmouth, shaking her head vehemently
and sucking in her breath at the same time.
“No-o-o, sir, ’twouldn’t never do, that wouldn’t. It must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
go all in a lump. Melmouth and me settled it that way
years an’ years ago. He’d save a shillin’, d’ye see, an’ I’d
scrape together another to put to it, an’ so we’d go on—for
a rainy day, he’d say—but no rainy day ever did
come——”</p>

<p>“And what a good thing that was,” chimed in the
farmer; “there isn’t many folks can say the same.”</p>

<p>“Very like there bain’t. Thanks be, as I do say, Mester
Hunt; thanks be for all mercies! But there ’tis, d’ye see.”
Here her face assumed an anxious expression and she
dropped her voice cautiously. “Who’s it to go to? Rector
do tell I, I ought to be makin’ my will.”</p>

<p>“True enough,” said Mr. Hunt judiciously; “so you
ought, Becky, so you ought.”</p>

<p>“Well, but,” resumed Mrs. Melmouth, “who’s to have
it? Melmouth, he wer’ set on its going in a lump. Says
he often an’ often, ‘Let it go in a lump, Becky, whatever
you do do. Settle it as you do like’—he did say—‘for
the dibs belongs to both on us equal. Let Simon (that’s
my nevvy) have ’em, or let ’em go to Rosy’—Rosy be his
sister’s oldest maid—‘but don’t divide ’em,’ says he; ‘let
’em go in a lump.’”</p>

<p>Here Becky paused, and the farmer looked at her in
silence, scratching his jaw in a non-committal manner.</p>

<p>“Sometimes,” resumed Becky, “it do seem as if ’twould
be right to leave it to Simon, him bein’ a man an’ my own
flesh an’ blood. That there bit o’ money—’twas me first
had the notion o’ puttin’ it by, and, as Melmouth did often
use to say, there couldn’t be no savin’ done in the house
wi’out I put my shoulder to the wheel. But, there! Rosy—Melmouth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
was oncommon fond o’ Rosy’s mother, and o’
Rosy herself when she was a little maid.”</p>

<p>“Ah! you haven’t seen Mrs. Tuffin an’ her family since
they shifted to Sturminster?” put in the farmer as she
paused.</p>

<p>Mrs. Melmouth shook her head.</p>

<p>“I often wish I could,” she said; “but ’tis so far.”</p>

<p>“An’ have ye seen Simon?” inquired the farmer. “He
be a dairy chap, bain’t he?—’tis some time since he went
to service.”</p>

<p>“Ah! he’ve a-got a very good place t’other side o’ Darchester.
He do write beautiful letters to my sister at
Christmas. There, they be jist same’s as if they come out
of a book.”</p>

<p>“P’r’aps they are out of a book,” suggested Mr. Hunt.
“There did use to be a book about letter-writin’ when I
was a young chap; but what it wanted to say was never
same as what I wanted to say, and my mother—poor soul!
couldn’t spell the long words, so I did give up using it.
But since ye haven’t seen either of these two young folks
for so long, Mrs. Melmouth, why not ax ’em both to come
and stop wi’ ye, an’ see which ye do like the best? You’d
soon find out then what they was both made on, an’ I’d pick
out the one as did please ye most to leave the stockin’ to.”</p>

<p>“Well, there, that’s a notion,” said Becky reflectively.
“I mid do that, I mid very well do that. Easter week,
Simon mid very well get a holiday—an’ Rosy—I mid ask
her mother to spare her to me at the same time.”</p>

<p>“Do!” said Farmer Hunt encouragingly. “I’ll reckon
ye’ll find ’tis a very good notion.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>“I reckon I will—and thank you, Farmer, for puttin’ it
into my mind. There, I should never ha’ thought on’t.”</p>

<p>“Two heads is better than one, ye see,” said Mr. Hunt.</p>

<p>And then he locked up the stocking again, handed Mrs.
Melmouth her basket, and betook himself to his midday
meal with the comfortable sensation which follows on a
good-natured act that has cost nothing.</p>

<p>Mrs. Melmouth left the house and trudged homewards,
revolving the new idea in her mind. Simon could have
the back bedroom, and Rosy could sleep with her; ’twas a
very good notion to have ’em both together; a man always
gave a deal o’ trouble in a house, and Rosy could help a
bit. Not but what Simon must make himself useful too.
His aunt privately resolved to hold over the setting of the
potatoes until he came; the bit o’ work he might do then
would go a good way towards his keep, reflected the thrifty
soul.</p>

<p>With much thought and care she penned her invitations
that afternoon; they were brief and to the point, intimating
in each case the writer’s wish to become better
acquainted with the young relative in question.</p>

<p>Rosy’s answer came by return of post, written in a
beautiful, round, clear hand which did credit to her schooling,
and accepting with rapture. Simon’s reply did not
come to hand for two or three days. It was ill-spelt and
ill-written on a somewhat dirty piece of ruled paper, which
looked as if it had been torn off the bottom of a bill:—</p>

<p>“Dear Ant,” it said, “i don’t know if i can be spaired,
but if the bos is willin i will cum. Yours truly nevew, <span class="smcap">S.
Fry</span>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>His aunt pursed up her lips as she perused this document.</p>

<p>“He mid ha’ taken a bit more pains,” she said to herself;
“he ha’n’t got this out of a book, anyhow.”</p>

<p>It was possible, indeed, that even <i>The Complete Letter-Writer</i>
did not contain a missive from a young man who
had been asked to spend his holidays with an aunt in the
country, and that Simon, in consequence, was thrown on
his own resources.</p>

<p>“But he don’t seem so very anxious to come,” she
thought. “He mid ha’ said ‘Thank ye,’ too—Rosy did
seem to be far more thankful. But Simon—p’r’aps he
means better nor what he says.”</p>

<p>With this charitable reflection Becky laid aside the letters
and went to feed her chickens.</p>

<p>Rosy, who was living at home, and in consequence not
tied down to any particular date, arrived a day before the
other guest. She was a pretty girl of the dark-haired,
clear-skinned type so often to be seen in Dorset; her eyes
were brown like her hair, and her complexion matched her
name to a nicety. The carrier dropped her and her tin
box at the corner of the lane which led to Mrs. Melmouth’s
cottage, and she came staggering down to her aunt’s door
bent in two beneath the weight of her belongings. Mrs.
Melmouth stood on the threshold and watched her.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” she remarked, as the girl set down her
trunk and straightened herself, breathless and laughing,
“I be main glad to see ye. Ye be sich a handy maid, my
dear. There, I declare ye’ve just come in nice time to get
the tea.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>Now Rosy, who was tired and thirsty after her long
jolting in the carrier’s van, had half-expected to find tea
ready. She felt a little bewildered and slightly annoyed
on being sent first to the well and then to the woodshed,
and then having to reach down the best china from the
top shelf, and, moreover, to dust it, conscious all the time
of wearing her best frock with sleeves too tight at the wrist
to turn up comfortably. It was a very crestfallen Rosy
indeed who finally sat down to partake of that particularly
well-earned cup of tea.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Melmouth was radiant.</p>

<p>“To-morrow,” said she, “I’ll get ye to make that there
back room ready for my nevvy.”</p>

<p>“Your nephew?” echoed Rosy, somewhat taken aback.</p>

<p>It had been well enough surmised by the Tuffin family
that Aunt Becky had a tidy sum put by, though they were
as ignorant of the precise amount as of the receptacle in
which she had stored it. The invitation to Rosy had
awakened certain half-formed hopes in the girl’s own
breast, as well as in those of her parents, and she looked
very blank at the announcement that a rival aspirant was
so soon to come upon the scene.</p>

<p>“Ah!” said Mrs. Melmouth, stirring her tea vigorously,
“my nevvy, Simon Fry. He be comin’ to spend his
hollerday here. That room ’ull want a good doin’ out,”
she continued placidly, “an’ there’s a lot o’ wold things
there as ’ull have to be shifted afore you can get to work.
But ye can get up pretty early—it’ll be ready time enough,
I dare say. He’ll not be here much afore tea-time.”</p>

<p>Rosy had formed certain private plans as to the disposal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
of her Good Friday; there were friends of her mother’s to
visit, old playmates of her own to look up—these, being of
the same age as herself, would doubtless have some little
jaunt in view. And now the whole day was to be spent in
cleaning up for Simon Fry. Simon, who was nephew by
blood to Aunt Becky, while she was only niece by marriage—there
could not be much doubt as to who would prove
the favourite. Rosy felt she had been inveigled from her
home on false pretences; it was not out of affection that
Mrs. Melmouth had sent for her, but simply to secure her
help with the housework and to make her wait upon Mr.
Simon Fry.</p>

<p>Her aunt glanced at her sharply as she flushed and bit
her lip, but made no remark; and presently Rosy regained
her good humour.</p>

<p>For was it not the sweetest of spring evenings, and were
not the thrushes singing in the wood just behind the cottage,
and were there not primroses in bloom on either side
of the path that led to the gate? Rosy could see them
through the open door and fancied she could smell them,
and the breeze that lifted her curly hair from her brow was
refreshing after her stuffy drive and recent labours. She had
come from a back street in Sturminster, where the air was
not of the same quality, and the surroundings far less inviting.</p>

<p>“’Tis nice to live in the country, aunt,” said she with a
bright smile.</p>

<p>Next morning she rose with the lark, and being strong
and capable had got Mr. Simon’s room into excellent order
before breakfast. As she made the bed she could not
resist giving a vicious thump or two to the pillow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>“Set ye up, indeed,” she murmured. “Ye may make
your own bed arter this, Mr. Dairy Chap!”</p>

<p>If she had hoped that her matutinal labours would leave
her free for the remainder of the day she was disappointed.
Mrs. Melmouth gave her a pressing invitation to assist her
at the wash-tub, having, as she informed her with an engaging
smile, expressly saved up the dirty linen for her
that week.</p>

<p>“To wash on Good Friday!” exclaimed Rosy, aghast.
“Dear, to be sure, aunt, ’tis the unluckiest thing you can
do.”</p>

<p>“Unlucky? Fiddlesticks!” retorted Mrs. Melmouth.
“A good day for a good deed—so say I.”</p>

<p>Rosy therefore remained immersed in suds during the
greater part of that day; and though at first she could
have cried with vexation, she soon found herself amused
by the old woman’s talk; and with every fresh excursion
to the hedge her spirits went up. The air was so fresh, the
sunshine so bright, the clean, wet linen smelt quite nice, she
thought, here in the country. Then the hedge itself, with its
little red leaf-buds gaping here and there so as to show the
crumpled-up baby leaves within—it had an attraction of
its own; and she could never be tired of looking at the
primroses that studded the bank beneath.</p>

<p>As she stood by the hedge on one occasion after having
tastefully disposed the contents of a basket on its prickly
surface, she was hailed by a voice from the road.</p>

<p>“Be this Widow Melmouth’s?”</p>

<p>The girl peered over the hedge at the speaker, her curly
hair flapping in the breeze, her cheeks pinker than ever,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
partly from her recent exertions, partly from excitement.
There stood a stalwart young countryman in corduroys
and leggings, a bundle in one hand, a stout stick in the
other. He had a brown, good-humoured face, with twinkling
blue eyes, and a smile that displayed the most faultless
teeth in the world.</p>

<p>“This be Widow Melmouth’s, bain’t it?” he repeated,
altering the form of his question.</p>

<p>“It be,” returned Rosy; then she nodded towards the
house. “My aunt’s inside,” said she.</p>

<p>Both, from opposite sides of the hedge, directed their
steps towards the gate.</p>

<p>“Your aunt?” said the young man. “Then we be
cousins, I suppose?”</p>

<p>And thereupon as each paused beside the gate, and
before Rosy had time to realise his intentions, he leaned
across and kissed her.</p>

<p>“How dare you!” cried Rosy, springing back and
rubbing her cheek vigorously, while tears of anger started
to her eyes. “How dare you, Mr. Fry? Cousins, indeed!
We be no such thing, and I’ll trouble you not to take
liberties. You’ll find your aunt indoor.”</p>

<p>With that she stalked back to her wash-tub.</p>

<p>“He’s come,” she announced as she passed Mrs. Melmouth,
who was engaged in rinsing out a few fine things
in a crock.</p>

<p>“Who? Simon! I’m glad to hear it. Ye’d best come
out a minute and make acquaintance.”</p>

<p>“I’ve made quite acquaintance enough,” retorted Rosy,
plunging her arms into the suds. “He’s an impudent chap!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>“I’ll go warrant you are a bit jealous,” said Mrs. Melmouth,
and with a chuckle she went forth to greet her
guest.</p>

<p>Indeed, from the very first it seemed evident that Rosy
had good cause for jealousy. Mrs. Melmouth seemed never
tired of commenting on Simon’s likeness to her family,
prefacing her remarks with the assertion that she had
always been dearly fond of Sister Mary. She further
observed two or three times during the course of the evening
that blood was certainly thicker than water, and that
a body should think o’ their own afore lookin’ round for
other folks. Poor Rosy, hot and tired after her exertions
at the wash-tub, took these hints in rather evil part; not,
indeed, that she was of a grasping nature, but that she
had an indefinable feeling of having been unfairly dealt with.</p>

<p>Simon, however, saw nothing amiss; it was apparent
that he looked upon his visit solely and wholly as an
“outing,” and had no ulterior views as to his aunt’s testamentary
dispositions. If he had ever heard of her savings
he had evidently forgotten about them; he had left home
young, and, except for the wonderful epistolary effort which
he sent to his mother each Christmas, corresponded little
with his family. He admired Rosy very much, and could
not understand why she was so short in her speech and
stand-off in her manner. It was perhaps her repellent
tone and evident moodiness which caused Mrs. Melmouth
to lay so much stress on Simon’s various good qualities.</p>

<p>During the course of the evening young Fry remarked
with a yawn and a stretch that he intended to have a good
sleep on the morrow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>“Jist about,” he added emphatically. “Ah! ’twill be
summat to hear clock strikin’ and to turn over warm an’
snug thinkin’ I needn’t get up to drive up the cows. To-morrow’s
Saturday, too—if I were yonder I’d ha’ had to
clean out fifteen pigstyes afore breakfast.”</p>

<p>“Think of that!” said Mrs. Melmouth. “’Tater-settin’s
different, bain’t it? Ye wouldn’t mind so much gettin’ up
a bit early to set ’taters—would ye, Simon?”</p>

<p>Simon’s jaw dropped, and he looked ruefully at his
relative.</p>

<p>“I thought I wer’ goin’ to have a real hollerday for
once,” he said hesitatingly. “There, if you do want me
to do any little job for ye in a small way I don’t mind
doin’ of it. But settin’ ’taters! You’ve a goodish bit o’
ground, an’ there is but the two days—I did look to have
my sleep out to-morrow,” he concluded desperately.</p>

<p>“I did count on ye,” persisted Mrs. Melmouth mildly.
“Ah! so did I. Said I to myself, ‘I’ll save up them ’taters
’gainst the time my nevvy do come’—I says. ‘He be a
good-natured young man,’ I says, ‘and I know he will do
what I do ax him.’ ’Tis beautiful weather for early risin’,
Simon, my dear, and you’ll feel the air so nice and fresh
while you’re workin’. I’ll have a dew-bit ready for ye.
Ye won’t disapp’int me, I’m sure.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I’ll not disapp’int ye,” returned Simon dolefully.
“I can’t work on Sunday, of course,” he added, brightening
up a little. “That’s summat, an’ if I work real hard to-morrow
I mid have a chance o’ gettin’ off a bit on Monday.
Where be the ’taters, aunt? If we was to cut up some o’
the sets to-night, we’d get on faster to-morrow.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>“Ah, to be sure,” agreed his aunt with alacrity. “I’ll
fetch a basket of ’em in a minute, an’ Rosy there can help
ye. She’ll be busy to-morrow cleanin’ up indoor; but
she’ll give you a hand to-night.”</p>

<p>But Rosy now felt the time had come for her to assert
herself. She glanced at the drawerful of stockings which
lay on the chair beside her, and then raised her eyes to her
aunt’s face.</p>

<p>“I know nothin’ about cuttin’ up sets,” said she, “an’ I
don’t fancy sich work. I’ve got all this darnin’ to do.
That’s enough for anybody, I think.”</p>

<p>“Oh, very well,” responded Mrs. Melmouth with some
dudgeon. “I’ll help you then, Simon. I’ll fetch ’taters,
an’ then I’ll help you.”</p>

<p>When she returned she found Simon and Rosy sitting
as she had left them, in absolute silence, Simon drumming
on the table and looking dubiously at Rosy, who darned
away without raising her eyes.</p>

<p>“There’s an odd stocking here,” she remarked snappishly,
as her aunt sat down. “What am I to do with that?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Melmouth, gazing at her sternly, determined
to profit by the opportunity her niece had unconsciously
presented to her, and to give her the lesson she deserved.</p>

<p>“That there stockin’,” she said impressively, as she took
it from the heap and held it up for their inspection, “that
there stockin’ is more vallyable nor it do look. It is feller
to one what’s worth farty pound.”</p>

<p>Both exclaimed and stared.</p>

<p>“I’ve always kep’ it for that,” resumed Mrs. Melmouth.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
“’Tis nigh upon farty year old—an’ the feller to it is worth
farty pound. Your uncle and me did begin savin’ the very
year we was first married, an’ I’ve a-gone on ever since.
When Melmouth died there was over thirty pound in it.
I didn’t like to have so much money about, livin’ here all
alone, so I axed Farmer Hunt to take charge on’t for me.
That’s ten year ago. Well, since then I’ve a-gone on
pinchin’ an’ scrapin’, a shillin’ here, a sixpence there, till
I’ve got together nigh upon ten pound more.”</p>

<p>“Well, I never heerd o’ such a thing!” exclaimed Simon
heartily. “Ye must have been wonderful clever an’ contrivin’,
Aunt Becky!”</p>

<p>“Ah, I’ll take that much credit to myself,” replied his
aunt. “I do truly think I was. But there it be now, an’
it be all to go in a lump to one o’ you two. I mid as well
tell you straight-out. ’Tis to go in a lump—Melmouth an’
me settled it that way. ‘We saved it between us, an’ you
can leave it,’ he says, ‘either to my niece or to your nevvy—but
it must go in a lump.’”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m sure!” said Simon; and then he looked
dubiously at Rosy, who was holding her curly head very
high. “’Twas very well said o’ the wold gentleman,” he
continued lamely.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t make up my mind no ways,” resumed Mrs.
Melmouth, “till at last I wer’ advised to have you both
here together and see for myself which I do like the best.
So if you do have to make yourselves a bit obligin’, it’ll
p’r’aps be worth your while. Ye mid be sure my choice
will fall on the most obligin’.”</p>

<p>Rosy smiled disdainfully and returned to her darning.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
It was easy to see, she thought, on whom the choice would
fall.</p>

<p>Simon eyed her askance, realising now the reason of the
girl’s evident aversion to himself, but he made no comment
beyond an occasional ejaculation under his breath. “Farty
pound! Well now! I’m sure ’twas very well thought on,”
and the like.</p>

<p>Next morning, just when Simon’s slumbers were at their
deepest and sweetest, he was awakened by an imperative
hammering and scratching at the partition which separated
his room from that of Mrs. Melmouth; and thereupon
dutifully, if somewhat reluctantly, he arose, and soon afterwards
found his way to the garden.</p>

<p>Early as it was, Rosy was already at work shaking
sundry bits of carpet, worn almost threadbare and terribly
dusty.</p>

<p>“Let me give you a hand,” exclaimed Simon gallantly.
“Sich work’s too hard for a maid.”</p>

<p>“No, thank ye,” returned Rosy sharply. “I shan’t get
much credit anyway; but what I said I’d do, I’ll do,” and
she gave another vicious shake to the ragged carpet.</p>

<p>“I be pure sorry you should think I want to rob ye of
any credit,” observed Simon mournfully. “There, you do
seem to ha’ turned again’ me terrible; and ’tis quite other-way
wi’ me—I did like ’ee from the first.”</p>

<p>“No thanks to ye, then!” retorted Rosy; and, snatching
up a stick, she began to belabour the mat with so meaning
an air that Simon felt as if the onslaught were committed
on his own shoulders.</p>

<p>“I wish you’d get on with your work,” she exclaimed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
presently. “You’re the favourite, and you’ll get the reward,
but you mid jist so well do summat to earn it.”</p>

<p>“Now look ’ee here,” said Simon, and his usually merry
eyes flashed angrily; “this here bit o’ business bain’t to
my likin’ no ways. What do I care for the wold stockin’?
I can earn enough to keep myself—ah, that I can—an’ I
could keep a wife, too, if I wanted one; an’ what’s farty
pound? The wold ’ooman had best keep it to be buried
with.”</p>

<p>“For shame!” cried Rosy. “’Tis pure ongrateful of ye
to speak so, and Aunt Becky so took up wi’ ye.”</p>

<p>“Well, I can’t help it,” returned the young man bluntly.
“The job bain’t to my likin’. I did come out for a hollerday,
and here I be ordered to set ’taters—an’ what’s more,
I get nothin’ but cross looks and sharp words what I don’t
deserve.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure your aunt speaks civil enough,” said Rosy in
a somewhat mollified tone.</p>

<p>“An’ so she mid,” responded he promptly. “She mid
very well be civil when she do expect so much. But there’s
others what’s uncivil, and ’tis that what I can’t abide. I’ve
a good mind,” he added gloomily, “to cut an’ run—yes,
I have,” he cried resolutely. “I’d sooner be cleanin’ out
pigstyes nor be treated so unkind as you do treat I. But
for that matter, my mother ’ull be glad enough to see I.
I’ll step home-along—that’s the very thing I’ll do; I’ll step
home-along.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but what will Aunt Becky say?” cried Rosy in
alarm.</p>

<p>“Aunt Becky be blowed!” exclaimed Simon with decision.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
“Let her say what she pleases. I’ll leave her an’
you to make it up together. ’Tis more nor flesh an’ blood
can stand to be treated as you’ve a-treated I since I did
come to this house.”</p>

<p>“Oh, please—please don’t go!” gasped the girl. “There,
I really didn’t mean—I—I—I only thought my aunt a bit
unjust.”</p>

<p>“Well, and very like she was,” said Simon magnanimously.
“I think the money what was saved out o’ the
man’s wage did ought to go to the man’s folk. You’ve
the best right to that there stockin’, Miss Rosy, and I’ll
not bide here to stand in your light.”</p>

<p>This was heaping coals of fire on Rosy’s pretty head
with a vengeance. She looked up in Simon’s face with
a smile, though there were tears in her eyes, and she
impulsively dropped the carpet and held out two little
sunburnt hands.</p>

<p>“Oh, please, Mr. Fry,” she said pleadingly, “please,
Simon, do stay—do ’ee now. I’ll—I’ll—I’ll never be unkind
again!”</p>

<p>“Is that a true promise, my maid?” asked Simon very
tenderly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Melmouth, chancing at that moment to emerge from
her house with the view of ascertaining how the young
folks’ labours were progressing, discovered them standing
in this most compromising attitude; Simon clasping both
Rosy’s hands, Rosy looking earnestly into his face; and
thereupon, true to her instincts, rated the couple soundly
for their idleness. In two minutes Rosy had returned to
her carpet with a flaming face, and Simon was walking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
slowly towards the potato-plot. As their aunt, still full
of virtuous indignation, was returning to the house, her
nephew’s tones fell distinctly on her ear:—</p>

<p>“How would it be if I was to give you a hand wi’ they
things first, my maid, and then you could be helping me
wi’ the sets?”</p>

<p>“Well, I declare,” commented Mrs. Melmouth, stopping
short, “I believe they’ve started coortin’. It do really
seem like it. Well, I never!”</p>

<p>She was turning about in preparation for a fresh outpouring
of wrath, when she was struck by a sudden idea, and
paused just as Rosy, with a nervous glance towards herself,
walked sheepishly up to Simon, trailing the carpet behind
her.</p>

<p>“We’d certainly get on much faster,” she said, speaking
ostensibly to Simon, but really for her aunt’s benefit.</p>

<p>“I d’ ’low ye would,” said Mrs. Melmouth; and suddenly
her brow cleared, and she turned once more to go indoors
with a good-humoured smile. “I d’ ’low you’ll get on fast
enough—wi’ the coortin’. But that ’ud be the best way o’
settlin’ it,” she added to herself—“I’ll leave the wold
stockin’ in a lump to ’em both.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">A WOODLAND IDYLL.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was the first Monday of August; the shops were shut
in the little town of Branston, but life in the neighbouring
villages was more astir than usual, for the men were for the
most part working in their gardens and the women stood
at their doorways or by their gates to view the passing
vehicles. These were not so numerous after all—one
might never have known it was a Bank Holiday—yet
every now and then a brake or a wagonette laden with
noisy folk rattled by, leaving a trail of dust to mark its
progress that lingered in a kind of cloud about the hedgerows
long after it had passed.</p>

<p>Two miles away on the downs, another kind of haze
caught the eye of Robert Formby as he strode across
them, the golden glimmering haze which indicates intense
heat; the sun had not yet set, but its rays struck the short
herbage as though they must scorch it, and made the white
streak of road which threaded the undulating tract positively
glitter. But yonder was Oakleigh Wood, heavily
green in its luxuriance of summer foliage. As Robert
swung along, with the fierce sunshine beating on his brown
neck and hands, he pictured it to himself: first, the grove
of firs with all its spicy scents streaming forth at this hour,
then the open space where the rabbits would presently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
frolic, then, stretching away, the wide dense coppice of hazel
and oak and ash. He thought of the broad drives where
the feet sank deep in cool lush grass, and of the narrow
and more secret paths between serried green walls, where
scarce a single burning ray might penetrate, though far,
far away at the very end of a long vista, a peep of luminous
sky was to be had.</p>

<p>Robert dwelt on it all, not as a poet or an artist would
have dwelt on it, revelling in its beauty, but as a man
thinks of familiar and undeniably pleasant things.</p>

<p>The young gamekeeper shifted his gun to the other
shoulder to ease himself, and swung his now disengaged
arm, whistling as he walked. Oakleigh Wood was situated
on a Dorset down, but Robert Formby was a North-countryman.
He had probably Danish blood in his
veins, for his big, loose-limbed figure, his blue eyes and
yellow hair and beard, would seem to belong to the race;
his complexion, too, had been fair but was now bronzed,
though when, impatient of the heat, he threw open the
collar of his flannel shirt, the lower part of his throat
showed white as milk.</p>

<p>A very energetic, sensible, clear-headed fellow was
Robert, full of zeal, and most laudably anxious to do his
duty. It was this zealous anxiety which brought him to
Oakleigh Wood on this particular occasion. It was just
possible that evil-disposed persons might take advantage
of the universal relaxation to trespass in these coverts; it
behoved Robert to see to that, he conceived.</p>

<p>Here were the woods at length, the undulating outlines
of which had wooed him from afar with such enticing promise;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
Robert’s feet fell almost noiselessly on a crumbling
carpet of pine-needles, and he paused a moment to sniff
the aromatic scent approvingly; then he went on. Now
the green depths engulfed him on every side; all was
gentle gloom, exquisite undefinable fragrance; silence the
more palpable because of the never-ceasing stir which
seemed to pervade it. What a variety, what a multiplicity
of scarcely perceptible noises go to make up the breathing
of the wood! The flapping of leaf against leaf, the swaying
of twigs, the rattle of falling nuts or sticks, the falling
apart of fronds of moss, the dripping of tiny drops of
dew or rain, the roamings of minute insects—each sound
infinitesimal in itself, yet repeated at thousands and millions
of points—in this harmony of life and motion, combining
with but never subduing the stillness of the forest,
lies its magnetism.</p>

<p>Sharper sounds break the all-pervading hush from time
to time without disturbing it; the cooing of a dove, the
flight of blackbird or thrush, the tapping of a woodpecker,
the croaking of a frog, the hasty passage of a
mouse through dry leaves; while the barking of a dog
in some distant village, and the clanging of sheep-bells
far away seem nevertheless to form part of the mysterious
whole.</p>

<p>Robert pushed his hat to the back of his head, rested his
gun against a forked sapling of birch, and, taking out his pipe,
was proceeding to fill it, when he suddenly started and threw
back his head, inhaling the air with a frown. A certain
acrid penetrating odour was making its way towards him,
drowning the more delicate essences of the forest growths.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>“’Tis wood smoke!” said Robert, and then his brow
cleared. “Mayhap somebody is burnin’ weeds nigh to
this place,” he said, and went on filling his pipe.</p>

<p>But before lighting it he once more raised his head and
shot a suspicious glance down the long green vista which
faced him: a faint bluish haze seemed to cling to the
over-arching boughs of the hazels. It was not the mist of
evening, for it proceeded from a certain point about half-way
up the narrow stretch, and, moreover, as Robert gazed,
little fresh wreaths came eddying forth to join the ethereal
cloud afore-mentioned. Restoring his pipe to his pocket,
and catching up his gun, Robert strode off in this direction
as rapidly as the narrowness of the path and the breadth
of his shoulders would admit of. He had indeed to proceed
in a curious sidelong fashion, turning now the right
shoulder forward, now the left, so that he looked almost as
if he were dancing. The cloud of smoke increased in
volume as he advanced, and presently he could actually
hear the hissing of flames and the crackling and snapping
of twigs; and now bending low, and peering beneath
the interlaced branches, he could see the fire itself. A
rather large beech-tree stood in the middle of the massed
saplings, with a small open space around it. In the centre
of this space a fire was burning briskly, and by the side of
the fire a girl sat with her elbows resting on her knees and
her chin sunk in her hands. Her hat was hung on one of
the beech-boughs, and a small open basket lay beside her,
from beneath the raised lid of which protruded the brown
spout of a teapot.</p>

<p>“My word!” said Robert to himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>Lowering his head he made a dive beneath the branches,
pushing some aside and breaking down others in his
impetuous advance, and in another moment, straightening
himself, he stood beside the girl, frowning at her
sternly. She raised her head and looked at him with
the action and something of the expression of a startled
deer; indeed her full dark eyes seemed to carry out the
comparison. She was a very pretty girl—so much Robert
saw at a first glance, yet the sight of her left him entirely
unmollified.</p>

<p>“What are you doing here?” he inquired roughly.
“You’re trespassin’—d’ye know that? I’ve a good mind
to summons ye!”</p>

<p>The girl scrambled to her feet; she was slender and tall,
her clinging pink cotton gown defining the shapeliness of
her form.</p>

<p>“I wasn’t doin’ any harm,” she returned with a pout.</p>

<p>Robert strode across the intervening space, and kicked
wrathfully at the fire which was cunningly composed of
sticks and fir-cones.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t!” cried the girl eagerly, “don’t! You’ll
spoil my ’taters!”</p>

<p>“’Taters indeed!” retorted Robert, but he drew back
the great boot which he had uplifted for the second time.</p>

<p>“Who gave you leave to come picnicking up here? I
s’pose you’re expectin’ a lot more trespassin’ folks same as
yourself?”</p>

<p>“No,” she said, shaking her head sorrowfully. “I was
just a-havin’ a little party for myself—I didn’t think no
harm.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>“A tea-party all to yourself,” said Formby, and in spite
of him, face and voice relaxed, “why, that’s dull work!”</p>

<p>“Everybody do seem to be merry-makin’ to-day,” she
went on, with a little toss of the head that contradicted a
certain quiver in her voice. “I thought I’d come out too,
and take my tea here. I don’t hurt nothin’. I d’ ’low the
wild things do know me quite well. I often walk here of
an evenin’ and the rabbits scarce run out of my road. I
do whoot like the owls and they do answer me back, and
bats come flyin’ round my head—I often fancy I could
catch ’em if I had a mind to.”</p>

<p>“Do ye?” said Robert.</p>

<p>He was bending down, resting a hand on either knee,
and peering up at her with a twinkle in his eye. She
nodded, and dropping on her knees beside the fire began
to draw together the embers with a crooked stick, and to
turn over the potatoes.</p>

<p>“They be very near done now,” she said; “this one be
quite done—will ye try it?”</p>

<p>Sitting back upon her heels she held it out to him with
a timid smile. Robert, shaking his head half-waggishly,
half-dubiously, took it from her.</p>

<p>“’Tisn’t right, ye know,” he protested, “nay, ’tisn’t right.
I didn’t ought to be encouragin’ of ye in such ways.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got some salt here,” cried she, rummaging in her
basket and bringing forth a twisted paper which she unfolded
and held out, poised on her little pink palm.</p>

<p>Robert deliberately sat down, broke the potato in two,
and dipped one of the smoking halves in the salt.</p>

<p>“Ye mustn’t do this no more,” he remarked severely;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
“nay, I’m not encouragin’ of ye, ye understand; ’tisn’t
allowed—this here’s a warnin’.” Here he took a bite out
of the potato—“Ye can be summonsed next time.”</p>

<p>The girl deposited the paper of salt upon the ground,
and, extracting another potato from the ashes, proceeded
to peel it deftly with a pocket-knife.</p>

<p>“Have ye got tea in that there basket?” inquired
Robert, still sternly.</p>

<p>“’Tisn’t made yet,” she replied, “but kettle ’ull boil in a
minute.” She pulled the basket towards her and unpacked
it with great rapidity.</p>

<p>“So that’s the kettle, is it?” commented Robert, as a
sooty object came to light, partially enveloped in a newspaper.
He weighed it in his hand. “There’s nought in it—eh,
I see you’ve got water in yon bottle. Shall I fill it?”</p>

<p>She nodded, and then making a pounce on a small
bottle of milk, endeavoured to uncork it. As the cork did
not yield, she was preparing to loosen it with her teeth
when Robert interposed.</p>

<p>“Here, hand o’er! What mun ye go breakin’ your
teeth for,” he inquired gruffly; “ye’ll noan find it so easy
to get more when they’re gone—more o’ the same mak’ as
how ’tis. They’re as white as chalk—and chalk’s easy
broke.”</p>

<p>He produced a large clasp-knife, and selecting a corkscrew
from the multiplicity of small implements which
were attached to it, drew out the cork with a flourish.
But the sight of the knife, which had been a present from
his former master, recalled graver thoughts, and it was in
a harsh admonitory tone that he next spoke:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>“’Tis all very well for once,” he said; “this ’ere tay-party
mun be overlooked for this time, I reckon; but there
mun be no more on ’em. Do ye hear, lass? These ’ere
woods is private, and Squire doesn’t intend no young
wenches to go trapesin’ about in ’em o’ neets, talkin’ to
the owls and that. I doubt ye don’t go lookin’ for bats
and owls alone,” went on the keeper in a tone of ferocious
banter. “I doubt some young chap——”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t!” interrupted she, flushing fiery red, “I can’t
bear it!”</p>

<p>And to his surprise and distress she burst into
tears.</p>

<p>“Eh, don’t ye cry, my lass!” he exclaimed with deep
concern. “Whatever have I said to hurt ye? I ax your
pardon. I meant no harm—no harm at all. Give over,
there’s a good lass.”</p>

<p>The girl sobbed on, with averted face. Robert looked
distractedly round, and his glance fell upon the kettle
which was boiling cheerfully.</p>

<p>“She’d like her tea,” he said, confidentially addressing
this kettle—“a sup o’ tea ’ull put her to rights. Come
we’ll make it in a minute.”</p>

<p>He reached for the teapot, rinsed it, dropped the contents
of another little twisted paper into it, and poured in the
boiling water.</p>

<p>“Don’t fill it quite full,” said the girl, turning sharply
round, and displaying a tear-stained face which was
nevertheless alight with interest.</p>

<p>“Oh, mustn’t I fill it? I always fill mine right up to
the brim.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>“Have you got nobody to do for you then?”</p>

<p>“Nay, I’m a single man. I have lodgin’s over yonder,
but I do for myself mostly.”</p>

<p>He paused looking at the girl curiously. “You never
told me your name,” he said.</p>

<p>“You did never ax me,” she said with a dawning smile.
“My name’s Rebecca Masters. I live down there, just at
the foot of the hill, wi’ my grandmother.”</p>

<p>“Father and mother livin’?” inquired Formby.</p>

<p>“No, they died when I was quite a little thing.”</p>

<p>“My father’s livin’ right enough,” he volunteered. “He’s
a fine old chap, my father is.”</p>

<p>“You’re Keeper Formby, bain’t ye?” inquired Rebecca
with interest.</p>

<p>“Eh! ye know me, do ye? A good few folks do, I
doubt.” Here Robert drew himself up; he felt what was
due to himself as a public character and once more his
voice took a graver inflection. “Now, see you, my lass,
you mustn’t coom here again.”</p>

<p>“I’m to have nothin’, an’ to do nothin’,” broke out
Rebecca passionately. “’Tis the only thing I care for,
comin’ here where I did use to walk when—when I was
happy.”</p>

<p>Robert paused with a potato midway to his mouth.</p>

<p>“Is he dead?” he inquired in a tone of respectful
sympathy.</p>

<p>“Who?”</p>

<p>“Your young man.”</p>

<p>“No,” she returned sharply, adding unwillingly, as if in
response to his expectant gaze, “he’s gone away.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>Robert pulled thoughtfully at his yellow beard, his blue
eyes looking very kind and sympathetic the while.</p>

<p>“P’r’aps he’ll coom back,” he hazarded after a moment.</p>

<p>“No, no, never!” she cried brokenly; then in a curiously
hard voice and with a sudden flash in her eyes—“What
do I care if he does? He’s nothin’ to me now—nothin’.
He’s gone an’ left me wi’out so much as a word—just took
an’ walked off. And he’ve never wrote either—not so
much as a word. He mid be dead only I do know he
bain’t.”</p>

<p>Formby continued to contemplate her, still stroking that
fine yellow beard of his.</p>

<p>“Poor lass! poor lass!” he said at last. “And ’tis a
comfort to you, is it, to coom walkin’ here? Well, see
you, my dear, you can coom here as often as ye like about
this time. I’m pretty often here mysel’ then, and ’twouldn’t
be same thing as if you was trespassin’. Ye mustn’t bring
no young chaps here, though,” he added after a pause. “I
doubt they’ll want to come, however little you might want
them. You’re a bonny lass—as bonny a lass as ever I see
in all my days!”</p>

<p>She heaved an impatient sigh.</p>

<p>“I did tell ’ee plain as I don’t want nobody,” she cried.
“Much good it do do me to be nice when——”</p>

<p>“Is there no other man at all i’ th’ world?” inquired
Robert.</p>

<p>“Not for me,” returned Rebecca.</p>

<p>Kneeling up, she began hastily to collect the tea-things,
and Robert, leaning forward, pushed them towards her
with willing clumsy hands. Then he rose to his feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>“I’m fain to hear ye say there’s no other man, my
wench,” he said, “but p’r’aps somebody ’ull coom.”</p>

<p>“What d’ye mean?”</p>

<p>“Somebody ’ull begin coortin’ ye afore long,” he
returned with conviction; “it might just as well be me as
another. If there’s nobody else, why not me?”</p>

<p>Rebecca now rose to her feet.</p>

<p>“I don’t want anybody,” she said.</p>

<p>“Somebody ’ull coom,” reiterated Robert, “an’ why not
me? Coom, my lass, I ax ye straight. Will ye give me
the first chance? Honest now! I like ye very well, an’ I
doubt I’ll soon like ye better. ’Tisn’t in nature as a lass
same as you can be for ever thinkin’ of a chap as has
showed no more feelin’ nor your chap has. Ye must tak’
another soon or late. Tak’ me—ye’ll not rue it.”</p>

<p>“I can’t settle to do such a thing all in a hurry,” cried
Rebecca petulantly. “I’ve never set eyes on you before.”</p>

<p>“Nor me on you,” returned Robert, “but I feel as if I
could like ye very well. Give me first chance—I don’t ax
for nought else. Let’s walk a bit an’ see how we get on;
but you must give me your word not to take up wi’ nobody
else while I’m on trial.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I can do that,” said she, and suddenly began to
laugh. The little white teeth which had already called
forth Robert’s admiration, showed bewitchingly; a dimple
peeped out near the lip, another in the chin.</p>

<p>Robert gazed at her rapturously. “I like ye very well.
Eh, my word, that I do! ’Tis a bargain—a proper
bargain!”</p>

<p>He had possessed himself of one of her little sunburnt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
hands, and was shaking it up and down; as she laughed
on, he drew her to him suddenly; but at that she started
back, striking out at him like a little wild cat.</p>

<p>“None of that,” she cried, “I’ll never ha’ nothin’ to say
to ye, if you do try to do things like that.”</p>

<p>“Eh, I ax your pardon,” faltered Robert, much abashed.
“I didn’t mean no harm, my dear—’tisn’t reckoned no
harm at all up i’ th’ North when folks begins coortin’.
You did look so bonny—an’ I just reckoned ’twould give
us a good start like.”</p>

<p>“I won’t have it then!” she broke out violently.</p>

<p>She stooped over her basket, packing away the remainder
of the tea-things with a certain amount of unnecessary
clatter. Robert, whose proffered help was curtly declined,
stood by dejectedly till she had concluded, when, snatching
up the basket, she darted suddenly from his side, and
bending her head rushed into the track. He immediately
followed her, carrying her hat which she had left suspended
on the branch.</p>

<p>“You’re forgettin’ this,” he began diffidently. “Now
then, lass, coom! This didn’t ought to make no difference.
Will ye gie me a straight answer?”</p>

<p>Rebecca had deposited her basket on the ground and
was putting on her hat with trembling fingers.</p>

<p>“I’ll think of it,” she stammered. “You must be
respectful though.”</p>

<p>A dark flush overspread Robert’s face.</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean nought but what was respectful,” he
said, “and ye’ve no need to think so much as that cooms
to. It must be Yes or No. I could never bear shilly-shally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
work. Yes or No—take me or leave me—on trial
of course. I only ax to be took on trial.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, I will,” she said in a low voice. “I d’ ’low
you are a good man, and as you do say I—I can’t always
be so lonesome.”</p>

<p>She paused a moment with downcast eyes; then, taking
up her basket again, turned away.</p>

<p>Robert stood stock still, watching her receding figure as
it flitted away down the long alley. The sun had now
set, and the woods were enveloped in even deeper mystery
than that which had possessed them a little while ago;
leafage and branch were inextricably mingled; yonder tiny
object in the path might either be a rabbit or a stump;
but Rebecca’s light dress defined her flying figure amid
the gloom which otherwise would have engulfed her.
Her shape showed white at first, then grey, as it receded
farther, until at last it stood out for a moment almost
black against the still glowing peep of sky which showed
between the over-arching boughs at the farther end; then
it vanished altogether. Even then Robert remained
gazing after her, and at length he heaved a deep sigh.</p>

<p>“Yon chap,” he said, “him as was her sweetheart—I
wonder if she was so stand-off wi’ him.”</p>

<p>The query seemed to open up an unpleasant train of
thought; he struck at the sod with the heel of his heavy
boot and frowned. “I’d ha’ summat to say to him if ever
I comed across him,” he muttered; and then turned to
continue on his beat.</p>

<p>“I never see a bonnier lass,” he said presently in a softer
tone; “poor lass—how pitiful she looked at me; I could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
do wi’ her very well—’tis to be hoped as she’ll mak’ up her
mind to do wi’ me.”</p>

<p>A bat twinkled round his head as he emerged into the
open, a host of rabbits scurried away at his heavy footfall.</p>

<p>“And all they dumb things love her,” meditated Robert.
“’Tis along of her bein’ so innocent-like! Eh, she’s a
flower.”</p>

<p>Soon he, too, had left the woods behind, and was marching
across the solitary down, grey at this hour save on the
upper slopes, where the short grass still caught some faint
remnant of the rosy after-glow. Night creatures were
stirring in every thicket that he passed, and as the dull
thud of his step fell upon the resonant ground it caused a
flutter and commotion amid the drowsy children of the
day, which had taken shelter there, deeming themselves
secure from disturbance. A rustle of wings, a patter of
tiny feet, a sleepy twitter, the shriek of a blackbird, the
heavy beat of a startled pigeon’s wings as it darted blindly
from its ambush—Robert held on his way without noticing
any of these things, and presently darkness and liberty
reigned undisturbed in the many-peopled waste.</p>

<p>For many subsequent evenings he visited Oakleigh
Wood at the specified time, but, though he patrolled it
from end to end, and strained his eyes in vain for a glimpse
of Rebecca Masters, not so much as a flutter of her skirts
rewarded his patient gaze.</p>

<p>Then, one day he suddenly heard an unwonted noise
proceed from a corner of the copse. An owl was hooting
intermittently; every now and then there came a pause,
and then the cry would be sent forth again. Now, though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
the bats had been circling about for some time, it was as
yet a little early for an owl to be abroad; and, struck by a
sudden thought, Robert set off running in the direction
whence the sound proceeded, imitating the call to the best
of his ability. As he expected, he found Rebecca standing
with her hands curved round her mouth, sending forth the
eerie cry. Her back was towards him, and it was not
until the ground vibrated beneath his rapid advance, that
she perceived his advent.</p>

<p>“Dear, to be sure, how you did frighten me!” she cried,
turning round with a little spring of terror.</p>

<p>“Did I?” said he. “You know you told me you often
hooted to the owls and they answered ye back. I thought
<i>I’d</i> answer ye—I thought I’d coom.”</p>

<p>She did not speak, though he stood towering over her
expectantly.</p>

<p>“Now I’m here must I bide?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“E-es, if you’ve a mind to.”</p>

<p>He thrust his hands into his pocket and drew out a
cluster of half-ripened nuts.</p>

<p>“Ye can bite into ’em,” he said; “they’ll not hurt your
teeth.”</p>

<p>Then he dived into his other pocket and held something
towards her cautiously; curled up in his brown palm was
a very small dormouse, sound asleep.</p>

<p>“’Tis for you,” he remarked briefly, “I’ve been carrying
it about three days and more, knowin’ as you’d a likin’ for
such things. ’Tis a mercy I’ve lit on ye at last, else it ’ud
maybe be dead.”</p>

<p>This was Robert Formby’s mode of courting. It appeared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
to be successful, for Rebecca looked up at him with
a bright smile.</p>

<p>“’Tis real good o’ ye,” she said. “There, I think it
awful kind.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got some shells at home,” he went on, brightening
up amazingly. “Do ye like shells?”</p>

<p>“Sea-shells?” she inquired.</p>

<p>“Ah! little shells as lays upo’ the beach when tide goes
down. I picked up a two-three handfuls when I wer’ last
at home.”</p>

<p>Rebecca looked up from the dormouse, which she had
been breathing upon to warm it, as it lay curled in her
hand. “Is your home near the sea then?”</p>

<p>“Aye—right among the sand-hills. I used to hear tide
come roarin’ in last thing o’ nights and first thing o’ morns
when I were a lad. My mother used to send me out to
fetch in drift for our fire—there’s always a lot o’ wood an’
chips an’ straw an’ stuff washed up upon the shore, an’ I
used to fill a basket in no time. Eh, in winter it used to
be nippin’ cold! Many a time I’d find my sticks all
froze together. ’Tis pretty nigh always sharp up yonder;
always a wind blowin’ fresh and free and salty on your
mouth.”</p>

<p>“Be it a nice place?”</p>

<p>“Well, I think it bonny—not same as this is bonny,
though. There’s sand-hills runnin’ all along the shore,
some big and some little, wi’ star-grass growin’ over ’em.
An’ t’other side o’ the hills there’s the plain country—fields
an’ that. Soil’s light, but crops does wonderful well, an’
there’s woods, and little dykes an’ pits nigh to the woods—eh,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
many’s the big snig I’ve catched!”—he paused, rubbing
his hands with retrospective relish—“but ’tisn’t not to say
bonny same as ’tis about here,” he concluded.</p>

<p>“There, it do seem strange as I’ve never so much as had
a sight o’ the sea,” said Rebecca. “They d’ say there’s a
good view o’ Poole Harbour from Bulbarrow, but I’ve
never been there.”</p>

<p>“Happen I might take ye there some day,” suggested
Robert. “Bulbarrow! that’s not so far.”</p>

<p>A certain startled look in the girl’s eyes warned him
that he was going too fast and he hastily changed the
subject, embarking on a somewhat incoherent account of
his childish adventures among the sand-hills. He went on
to describe the dunes themselves more minutely, and then
the river which ran along the shore so sluggishly that,
however blue and clear the distant sea might be, the waves
that broke upon the beach were always brown and muddy.</p>

<p>“That’s not nice,” said Rebecca.</p>

<p>“Nay,” acquiesced Robert unwillingly; “nay, I suppose
not, but I liked it well enough.”</p>

<p>“Better than this?” asked the girl quickly.</p>

<p>The man’s sea-blue eyes looked straight into her face.</p>

<p>“Not now,” he said.</p>

<p>Next day when he came to Oakleigh Wood at the
usual hour he made straight for the spot where he had
heard the fictitious owl-hooting on the previous evening;
and his heart leaped high when a repetition of the sound
fell upon his ear. A few of his rapid strides brought him
to the spot: Rebecca was standing beneath the beech-tree,
as before, but so as to face the path, and as he approached<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
she dropped her hand by her side with a little
laugh.</p>

<p>“I knowed it was you,” said Robert breathlessly.</p>

<p>“I did it a-purpose,” said she.</p>

<p>His face lit up with tender triumph. It was as though
some timid creature of the woods had been coaxed within
reach of a friendly hand; its shyness was vanishing, but
dared he as yet take hold?</p>

<p>He asked himself this question many times during their
subsequent meetings; the girl would prattle to him confidently
enough, and seemed interested in all his doings, past
and present, but an impenetrable reserve took possession
of her whenever he tried to speak about herself, and once
when he offered to accompany her home, she curtly refused.</p>

<p>“Folks ’ud get talkin’,” she said.</p>

<p>Midway in September, Robert thought it time to put
matters on a more business-like footing. With every day
that passed he had fallen more deeply in love, and it
seemed to him only right that their intercourse should be
recognised as courtship proper—the necessary preliminary
to matrimony.</p>

<p>He approached the trysting-place with a serious face
therefore, and, as was his way, came to the point at
once.</p>

<p>“We’ve been walkin’ nigh upon seven week now,” he
remarked. “Do ye think ye can do wi’ me, lass?”</p>

<p>Rebecca turned sharply towards him with that frightened
look in her eyes which he had learned to accept as a warning.
This time, however, he was not to be deterred from
his purpose, and went on, very gently but steadily:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>“Ye took me on trial, ye know. Will I do, think you?”</p>

<p>“Do for what?” she faltered.</p>

<p>“For a husband, my dear. Ye’ve no need to be scared.
I don’t want to hurry ye, but I think ’tis time to put
the question straight. I’ve been coortin’ you reg’lar.
Coom, will ye wed me?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” cried Rebecca, darting suddenly away from
him, “no, no, never! I don’t want to get married—I don’t—I
never said I would.”</p>

<p>Robert followed her and took her gently by the shoulders.</p>

<p>“There! No need to be so scared, my wench. Nobody
’ull force ye—don’t think it. I did but ax—but we’ll say
no more about it—not for a bit, till ye get more used to
the notion. I’m content to bide as we are. There now!
Give over tremblin’. I’ll not hurt ye. See, you’re as free
as the birds.”</p>

<p>He removed his hands from her shoulders and smiled:
this woodland thing was only half-tamed after all; he
must be patient with it still, but he dreamed of the time
when it would come at his call and nestle in his breast.</p>

<p>Autumn advanced rapidly that year—a golden luxuriant
autumn, ablaze with colour and lavish with fruit. The
thorn-trees upon the downs were laden with berries, the
bryony flung long graceful tendrils from side to side of the
thickets, chains of transparent gold, bearing here a beryl,
and there a topaz, and there a coral bead. The blackberry
brambles displayed their wealth in more wholesale fashion,
for their clusters were now entirely black and now red.
The days were still hot enough to cause Robert to throw
open coat and shirt-collar when he crossed the down, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
the nights were cold; a thick dew coated the grass, almost
a white frost. In the secret recesses of the copse, where
the sun scarcely penetrated, lay silvery patches by day as
well as by night.</p>

<p>One afternoon Robert came gaily to the accustomed
meeting-place, but found no one there.</p>

<p>“I’m a bit early,” he said to himself; “I’ll have a look
round and then come back. I think she’ll wait—ah, I
reckon she’d wait a bit for me now. She’s gettin’ used to
me. I reckon she’s gettin’ to take to me.”</p>

<p>Smiling to himself he left the wider track and turned
aside into one of the narrower alleys before described.
The leaves were yellowing here on either side; and the grass
beneath his feet was covered with thick rime. As he edged
himself along it, lost in meditation, he suddenly stopped
short, gazing fixedly at the ground. Its hoary surface
bore traces of recent footsteps: a man’s footsteps—and a
woman’s. They stared up at Robert as it seemed to him,
and all at once, though he had been glowing with health
and happiness a moment before, he fell a-shivering.</p>

<p>He knew the little foot that made those tracks—only
the week before he had laughed admiringly as he had
marked its impression in the dew. A little foot—and a
great one side by side with it. A man’s foot! How
close they must have walked there in the narrow path!</p>

<p>Robert’s shivering fit ended as suddenly as it had begun,
and the blood coursed madly through his veins—hot enough
now—boiling hot. His fingers closed tightly round his
gun and he rushed forward, brushing aside the close-growing
branches, on, on, never stopping, yet keeping his eyes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
fixed all the time upon those tell-tale tracks. Now they
were lost in one another, now they were interlaced, now
quite distinct and separate, side by side. He stopped
short when he came to the junction of the path with the
wider one in which it merged, a path which traversed the
wood from end to end. Robert cast a hasty glance to
left and to right and stood transfixed. Yonder where the
green roadway abutted on the down he saw two figures
standing out dark against the lambent evening sky—a tall
and slender woman, a taller man. As he gazed transfixed
he saw the man stoop and gather the woman in his arms;
and then the two parted, the man walking away across
the grass, the woman turning to the right and disappearing
into the wood.</p>

<p>“She’s comin’ to our beech-tree,” said Robert to himself;
“she’s comin’ to meet me.”</p>

<p>And for the moment he saw the world red.</p>

<p>He too turned and began to stride fiercely towards the
trysting-place. As he entered the wider track he stopped
and looked to his gun. But one barrel was loaded. He
twisted round his cartridge bag, and with impatient, trembling
fingers found the cartridge for the other barrel.</p>

<p>He reached the beech-tree first and stood gripping his gun
tight and glaring up the path, still through that red haze.</p>

<p>All at once he saw her coming, very slowly, with her
head bent.</p>

<p>Half-hidden by the tree-trunk he waited, motionless as
a statue, for her to give the accustomed signal; at the first
sound of it he would shoot her through the heart.</p>

<p>She came quite near, raised her head, and sighed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>Then the keeper made a step towards her; his grip on
the gun relaxed.</p>

<p>“You here already?” she asked, and turning towards
him laid her little hands upon his breast. It was the
first time she had ever voluntarily touched him, and the
man started and flushed.</p>

<p>“Robert,” she said falteringly. “I—I—want to tell ’ee
summat.”</p>

<p>Then his great chest heaved and the gun dropped from
his hand.</p>

<p>“Eh, bless you for that word, my lass!” he cried
brokenly. “I reckoned you meant to cheat me.”</p>

<p>“Then you do guess?” stammered Rebecca. “Oh,
Robert—’tis Jim. He be come back—he only went away
to get work after all.”</p>

<p>Robert’s heart leaped up with an odd mixture of anguish
and joy. It was her sweetheart—“the only man in the
world”. Who could blame the lass?</p>

<p>“Ah,” he said unsteadily, “coom back, is he? It’s right
then. You be in the right to stick to him if he’ll stick to
you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, e-es,” returned the girl quickly, “he’ve a-come back
for that—he do want us to get married at once.”</p>

<p>A spasm crossed Robert’s face. “You’re not afeard
now, I see,” he said.</p>

<p>“Oh, I can’t help it, I can’t help it,” she cried. “I love
him best—I did al’ays love him best, but I—I—oh, Robert,
I be so sorry!”</p>

<p>He drew down her hands and gently shook them; then
he let them drop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>“It’s right,” he said, “ye’ve no need to fret yoursel’, my
lass—you’re a good lass—I give ye j’y.”</p>

<p>He stooped and picked up his gun, half-absently unloading
it, and dropping the cartridges into his pocket.
Then he turned towards Rebecca again.</p>

<p>“I’ll say good afternoon,” he said.</p>

<p>Rebecca extended her hand with a sob, and he shook it
once more.</p>

<p>“Good afternoon,” he repeated, and left her.</p>

<p>The sun had not yet quite set as he crossed the open
space that lay between the woods proper and the outlying
grove of fir-trees; its level shafts struck the ruddy trunks
of these and ran along the lower branches, turning the
very needles into fire; the aromatic scent gushed forth,
strong and sweet. Yonder the downs were all ablaze in
the same transitory glow; the distant hills were sapphire
and amethyst, the nearer woods a very glory of autumn
tints and sunset fires. Robert stood still as he emerged
into the open; his heart was swelling to suffocation, his
eyes smarting with unshed tears. They are children of
nature, these burly Northmen, and he would have been
fain to weep now, though he had not wept since that far-away
day when, as a little lad, he had seen them lay his
mother in the grave. A great loathing of the beauty and
the radiance and the sweetness which had encompassed
his dead dream, came upon him; in his actual physical
oppression he thought with a sick longing of the pure tart
air blowing over the dunes at home; the tall bleak
dunes, all sober grey and green; the brown waves leaping
in upon the tawny shore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>“I reckon I’ll shift,” said Robert.</p>

<p>And early on the following morning, when the yellowing
leaves of Oakleigh Wood were catching the first rays of
the sun, Robert Formby took to the road, with his face
turned northwards.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE CARRIER’S TALE.</h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">E-es</span>, I d’ ’low I do see a-many queer things while I be
a-goin’ o’ my rounds, year in, year out, every Tuesday an’
Friday so reg’lar as clockwork—only when Christmas Day
do fall on a Friday, or Boxin’ Day, an’ then I do have to
put it off. E-es, I do often say to Whitefoot when he an’
me be joggin’ along; ‘Whitefoot,’ I d’ say, ‘if you an’ me
was to get a-talkin’ of all we’ve a-seen in our day, Lard!
we could tell some funny tales.’ Whitefoot do seem to
take jist so much notice as what I do do—he be the
knowin’est mare in the country. There! ye midn’t notice
as he be a-goin’ along a bit unwillin’ to-day, same as if he
hadn’t a-got much heart in him; ’tis because he knows so
well as me what day ’tis—Friday, d’ye see? He d’ know
he’ll have to bring back a heavy load. Fridays we calls
at Brewery for two or three cases o’ bottled beer—we
do bring ’em full o’ Fridays up to Old’s, at Graychurch—right
a-top o’ the hill—an’ we do fetch back empties o’
Tuesdays, an’ then ye should jist see Whitefoot a-steppin’
along.</p>

<p>“E-es, we do see all sorts o’ things, an’ we do hear all
kind o’ talk. Miffs do go on many a time under that there
wold green shed. When I do hear folks a-havin’ words
one wi’ t’other, I do never take notice if I can help it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
Sometimes they’ll be for drawin’ me in. ‘Don’t ye think
so, Jan?’ one ’ull say; and then another ’ull go, ‘I’m sure
Jan ’ull agree wi’ I’. An’ I do always make the same
answer, ‘Settle it among yourselves, good folks,’ says I;
‘I don’t take zides wi’ one nor yet wi’ t’other. ’Tis my
business for to drive, an’ I do do that,’ I do tell ’em, ‘and
don’t interfere wi’ nothin’ else.’</p>

<p>“One day I d’ mind, Mrs. Collins, what fell out wi’ her
darter for marryin’ some chap down to Bere—dalled if
she didn’t meet the young woman plump in my cart! And
they hadn’t been speaking for above a year.</p>

<p>“You see, ’twas this way. I took up Mary—that’s the
darter—an’ her little child—a hinfant it was, not above
four or five month old; I took ’em up first, an’ we was
goin’ along the road Branston-ways, an’ it was gettin’
darkish when the wold lady met us.</p>

<p>“‘Can you make room for me, Jan?’ she says. ‘I
bain’t so young as I was, an’ I’ve a-got a pair o’ new boots
what do fair lame me.’</p>

<p>“‘To be sure, mum,’ says I. ‘Up wi’ ye; you can set
along of I,’ I says, ‘here in front. There bain’t much
room under the shed.’</p>

<p>“Well, she sits her down, an’ all of a minute the little
baby under the shed begins a-cryin’, an’ poor Mary she
begins a-hushin’ of it an’ a-talkin’ to it; and soon as ever
the wold ’ooman hears her voice she gives a great start
what very nearly throws her off the seat.</p>

<p>“‘Studdy, mum,’ says I; ‘if you do go a-jumpin’ up
an’ down like that we’ll be a-droppin’ of ye into the road,’
I says.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>“She made no answer and never turned her head.</p>

<p>“Well, the baby kep’ on a-cryin’ and a-cryin’—it had
been vaccinated or some such thing—an’ the mother kep’
hushin’ it, an’ at last the wold ’ooman couldn’t hold out no
longer.</p>

<p>“‘Give I that child, Mary,’ says she, sharp-like. ‘I d’
’low you don’t know how to hold it,’ she says. ‘’Tis a
shame to let a pore little hinfant scream like that. I d’
’low ’twill do itself a mischief.’</p>

<p>“‘Oh, mother,’ says poor Mary; an’ she begins to cry
herself as she hands over the child.</p>

<p>“Well, soon as ever Mrs. Collins had a-got hold o’ the
little thing, an’ got the little face up again hers an’ began
singin’ to it, an pattin’ it, an’ rockin’ it, it <i>did</i> stop cryin’—’twas
a knowin’ little thing, that baby, I did al’ays say
afterwards, for ’twas that done the job. The wold body
was so pleased as could be.</p>

<p>“‘Didn’t I say you didn’t know how to hold it?’ says
she. ‘’Tis a very fine child too,’ she says.</p>

<p>“And then, ‘oh, mother,’ says Mary, ‘I did so want ye
to see it.’</p>

<p>“And so they made friends straight off, and Mary went
home wi’ her mother to tea.</p>

<p>“Coortin’? Well, we don’t see so much o’ that—not
these times. The young chaps be all for bicylin’ these
days; they wouldn’t be bothered wi’ travellin’ in my cart.
But I do mind one queer thing what happened many years
ago now—dally! ’twas the very queerest thing as ever I
knowed, or did happen in these parts.</p>

<p>“’Twas one Tuesday. I wur jist puttin’ in Whitefoot,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
an’ a few o’ my fares was a-standin’ about waitin’ for I to
be ready to start, when I see a great big fellow marchin’
down the hill from Old’s.</p>

<p>“‘Goin’ Branston-way?’ says he with a nod to I.</p>

<p>“‘E-es,’ I says, ‘I be goin’ Branston-way. Be you a
stranger?’ says I. ‘All the folks as lives about here
do know as Branston is my way.’</p>

<p>“‘I’m a stranger and I’m not a stranger,’ says he. ‘My
folks used to live here. I used to live with my grandfather
up yonder at Whitethorns,’ he says. ‘He was called old
Jesse Taylor—d’ye mind him?’</p>

<p>“‘I mind him very well,’ says I. ‘A fine wold fellow.’</p>

<p>“‘Well, I come here to have a look at his grave,’ says
the young chap. ‘’Twas a notion I had.’</p>

<p>“‘Let me see,’ says I, turnin’ round to look at ’en as I
were a-climbin’ into the cart, for Whitefoot was hitched by
this time, ‘let me see who mid you be then? Wold Taylor
had nigh upon farty grandchildren—I heard ’en say so
many a time.’</p>

<p>“‘Oh, I’m one of Abel’s lot,’ says he; ‘Abel Taylor was
my father’s name. He emigrated wi’ half a dozen of us
when I was a little lad no higher than the shaft there; my
name is Jim Taylor. I have spent most of my life in the
States; I scarce call myself a Britisher now,’ says he.</p>

<p>“‘Dear, to be sure,’ says Mrs. Mayne, what was a-standin’
by, ‘’tis very sad for to hear ye say that, Mr.
Taylor. Ye must feel very mournful havin’ to live out
abroad.’</p>

<p>“‘I don’t know that,’ says he. He was a honest, good-natured-lookin’
chap, but when he says ‘I don’t know that’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
he looked real melancholy. There; ye’d think some awful
misfortune had happened. ‘I don’t know that,’ he says;
‘there’s good and bad all over the world, and there’s as
much bad as good in England, I guess.’</p>

<p>“He had a funny way o’ talking: ‘I guess,’ he says,
meanin’ for to say ‘I d’ ’low’.</p>

<p>“They was all in the cart by this time, an’ Whitefoot
was a-trottin’ out so brisk as could be. He was a young
mare then, and ’twas a Tuesday, as I say, an’ he knowed
he’d have only the empties to carry along.</p>

<p>“Wold Maria Robbins was a-sittin’ jist behind Jim
Taylor—a great talker she was, al’ays ready to gossip
about her neighbours. She did sit a-starin’ an’ a-starin’
at this here Jim Taylor till I reckon he felt her eyes fixed
on ’en, for he turns round smilin’ wi’ some talk about the
weather. But ’twasn’t the weather as Maria did want to
be talkin’ on.</p>

<p>“‘I’m sorry, Mr. Taylor,’ says she, ‘as you’ve a-been
disappointed like in your country,’ she says. ‘I’m sorry
England didn’t come up to your expectations.’</p>

<p>“He laughed and began pulling at his girt brown beard.</p>

<p>“‘’Twill maybe l’arn me not to expect too much,’ he
says.</p>

<p>“‘I’ll go warrant ’twas a maid what played some trick
on ye,’ says Maria, a-turnin’ her head on one side same as
an old Poll-parrot.</p>

<p>“‘Maids be tricky things,’ says he; but he didn’t give
her no more satisfaction.</p>

<p>“Well, Mrs. Mayne, what was a-sitting on the t’other
side o’ the cart, was jist as anxious to pick all she could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
out of ’en, an’ says she, pokin’ out her head from under
the shed:—</p>

<p>“‘I d’ ’low,’ she says, ‘there isn’t many English maids
as would fancy the notion of goin’ out abroad to get
married. Most English maids,’ says she, ‘likes to settle
down near their own folks, an’ not be tolled off amongst
strangers.’</p>

<p>“The wold ’ooman had jist knocked the nail on the
head. The chap turns round about again wi’ his back to
’em both, an’ the dark look on his face.</p>

<p>“‘Folks are free to please themselves,’ says he, arter a
bit, ‘but they should know their own minds. It shouldn’t
be “I will” one day and “I won’t” the next.’</p>

<p>“Well, he didn’t seem in the humour to talk much after
this, and we did drive on half a mile or so wi’out openin’
our lips, till all at once we came to a turn in the road, and
there was a lot o’ folks a-waitin’ for I.</p>

<p>“’Twas Meadway what lives down there in the dip, an’
his wife, an’ three or four of his sons an’ daughters, an’ a
couple o’ chaps what works for ’en; they was all gathered
round his niece, Tamsine, as was standin’ waiting for I,
dressed very nice for travellin’.</p>

<p>“They was makin’ sich a din when I pulled up a body
could scarce hear hisself speak.</p>

<p>“‘Up wi’ the box,’ says one, a-tossin’ it up a’most afore
I could get my feet out o’ the way. ‘Here be thy band-box,
maidie,’ says another. ‘Now, Jan, make room. Good
luck, my dear.’</p>

<p>“’Twas old Tom Meadway as did say that, an’ he no
sooner let fall the word than the whole lot of ’em took it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
up. ’Twas ‘Good luck’ here, and ‘Good luck’ there, and
the poor maid pulled about from one side to the other, an’
sich kissin’ I thought she’d be in pieces afore I did have
her in my cart.</p>

<p>“At last she got in. Maria did have to go and sit next
Mrs. Mayne, and Tamsine Meadway took her place behind
Jim Taylor, what sat next I.</p>

<p>“‘Drop us a line so soon as you get to the other side,’
says Mrs. Meadway.</p>

<p>“‘Mind ye tell us what he’s like,’ cries one o’ the maids.</p>

<p>“‘Lard, Tamsine,’ says another, ‘I could wish I was
you.’</p>

<p>“Then they did all start a-cheerin’, an’ two of ’em
popped their heads in under the shed, laughin’ fit to split,
and throwin’ somethin’ at the poor maid, an’ she jumps up
an’ throws it out again, an’ then another maid comes an’
throws a handful o’ summat almost into her face.</p>

<p>“‘Come,’ says I, ‘I’d best be gettin’ on, or they’ll make
an end on ye, maidie.’ So I touches up Whitefoot, an’ we
soon leaves ’em all behind, laughin’ an’ shoutin’.</p>

<p>“‘Ye shouldn’t ha’ thrown back the shoe,’ says Mrs.
Mayne to Tamsine; ‘that was for luck, my dear.’</p>

<p>“‘They mid ha’ shown a bit more feelin’,’ says Tamsine,
and a body could hear she weren’t far off cryin’.</p>

<p>“‘If all the tale be true what I hear,’ says Maria Robbins,
‘you be a very brave young ’ooman. Be it really true as
you be goin’ to ’Merica to marry a man what you’ve never
seen?’</p>

<p>“‘Why, of course ’tis true,’ puts in Mrs. Mayne, ‘and a
very good job, too. What could anybody do, you know,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
Miss Robbins?’ she says to Maria. ‘There’s poor Robert
Meadway left his family terrible bad off, and such a lot of
’em, too, and none of ’em fit to earn a penny wi’out it’s
Tamsine herself.’</p>

<p>“‘Why didn’t she take a place, then?’ says Maria. ‘I’d
a deal sooner go to sarvice nor set out on this ’ere wild
goose chase. Ye’ll have to work jist so hard,’ she says,
turnin’ to Tamsine, ‘and the Lard knows what sort of a
place it is you be a-goin’ to, nor what kind of a chap your
husband ’ull turn out to be.’</p>

<p>“‘I shouldn’t mind the work,’ says Tamsine; ‘of course
I’d be willin’ to work for my husband, whoever he mid
be.’</p>

<p>“She had a kind of soft, pleasant voice, and Jim, when
he heard it, turned round to look at her. I did turn
round, too.</p>

<p>“‘What’s this tale?’ says I. ‘I never heard nothin’ of
it,’ I says.</p>

<p>“‘Ah,’ says Mrs. Mayne, ‘Meadways did keep it dark,
d’ye see, till all was settled; but ’tis quite true as Tamsine
here be a-goin’ out to America to get wed to a man what
lives out there. A very good match it do seem to be, too.
A large farm, I d’ ’low, and a comfortable house. And
Tamsine’s intended do write beautiful letters, Mrs. Meadway
telled I.’</p>

<p>“Tamsine says nothin’, but keeps on pickin’ up the little
bits o’ rice what her cousins had throwed at her, an’ droppin’
of ’em out o’ the cart. She was a very handsome
maid, wi’ black eyes an’ hair, an’ a pretty bit o’ colour as a
general thing, but her face was so white as chalk that day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>“‘Well,’ says Maria, speakin’ a bit sour, as wold maids
will when there’s talk of young ones gettin’ wed. ‘I don’t
think it’s at all proper nor becoming to go answer they
advertisements what comes in the papers, an’ for such a
thing as wedlock—Lard ha’ mercy me,’ she says, ‘however
had ye the face to do it, Tamsine?’</p>

<p>“‘’Twas my cousin Martha what did it,’ says poor
Tamsine, hangin’ down her head. ‘’Twas in the <i>Western
Gazette</i>—a very respectable paper, my uncle says. We
was lookin’ out for a place for me, and Martha she saw the
advertisement. It said the gentleman wanted a wife from
Dorset. Martha said it did seem like a chance for I, an’
she took and wrote straight off, more for a bit of fun than
anything else, but when the answer came it was wrote
quite in earnest. It said the gentleman had knowed some
girl what came from Dorset, an’ he ’lowed he’d like a
Dorset wife. He gave two references, one to a bank what
said, when my uncle wrote, he was very respectable and
well off, and one to a minister as said he was a very good
man and ’ud make any ’ooman happy. We be chapel-folk,
too, and Uncle Meadway said the offer did seem the very
thing for I.’</p>

<p>“‘You were forced into it, then?’ says Jim Taylor,
speakin’ out straight and sharp.</p>

<p>“‘Oh, forced,’ says she, makin’ shift to look up, ‘I
couldn’t say forced.’</p>

<p>“But there were the big tears gatherin’ in her eyes—anybody
could see she hadn’t had much say in the
matter.</p>

<p>“‘My uncle said,’ she goes on, ‘I could have some of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
the little ones sent out to me by-an’-by, an’ Mr. Johnson
wrote very nice about it, and said he wouldn’t have no
objections.’</p>

<p>“‘What d’ye say the party’s name is?’ axes young
Taylor, very quick.</p>

<p>“‘Johnson—Samuel Johnson,’ says the poor maid.</p>

<p>“Well, if ye’ll believe me, the chap got so red in the
face as if somebody had hit ’en.</p>

<p>“‘Samuel Johnson,’ says he. ‘For the Lard’s sake,
where does he live?’</p>

<p>“‘’Tis in California,’ says Tamsine; ‘he’ve a-got a farm—a
ranch he calls it—at a place called Longwood.’</p>

<p>“‘Sakes alive!’ cries Jim, an’ he sits there gawkin’ at
the maid.</p>

<p>“‘Of all the durned cheek!’ says he at last, speaking in
his queer fayshion. ‘If the boys around was to know he
had the face to ax a young British girl to marry him, I tell
ye what,’ he says, ‘he’d be lynched afore he knew where
he was!’</p>

<p>“‘Dear, to be sure,’ cries Mrs. Mayne, a-clappin’ of her
hands together, ‘what’s wrong wi’ the man?’</p>

<p>“‘P’r’aps he’s got a wife already,’ says Maria.</p>

<p>“‘Maybe ’tisn’t the same Samuel Johnson,’ says I. ‘I
d’ ’low I seem to ha’ heerd o’ the name afore.’</p>

<p>“‘’Tis a play-actin’ kind o’ a name,’ says Maria.</p>

<p>“Poor Tamsine, she was so white as any sheet, an’ she
did stretch out her hand an’ grab hold o’ Jim by the sleeve,
an’ shake ’en.</p>

<p>“‘Tell I quick,’ she cried; an’ then she drops her hand,
an’ begins a-cryin’.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>“‘No, don’t tell me,’ she says; ‘don’t ye tell me nothing.
I’m bound every way. I’ve a-passed my word,’ says she;
‘an’ he’s actually sent the money for my ticket. I can’t go
back now!’</p>

<p>“‘Yes, but you shall go back,’ cries Jim, a-catchin’ of
her by the wrist. ‘I’ll not stand by—no honest man could,
an’ see a young girl—a good honest young girl, sold to
such a chap as Johnson. Why, he’s a nigger!’ he cries.</p>

<p>“Poor Tamsine, I thought she’d ha’ fell off the seat.</p>

<p>“‘A black man!’ screeches she.</p>

<p>“‘As black as my shoes,’ says Jim. ‘A great big, oily,
dirty nigger,’ says he.</p>

<p>“He didn’t pick his words, d’ye see.</p>

<p>“‘Why, his head’s as woolly as a sheep’s back,’ he says.</p>

<p>“‘No, my girl,’ he goes on, ‘it can’t be allowed.’</p>

<p>“‘But I’m bound,’ says Tamsine, wi’ her face working
pitiful.</p>

<p>“‘You are no more bound nor I am,’ says he. ‘The
rascal’s imposed on ye shameful. He knows right well
he’d no business to ax a white girl to marry him wi’out
tellin’ her all the truth. Why didn’t he ax you straight if
you’d be willin’ to take up wi’ a black man? But he
knowed a deal better nor that.’</p>

<p>“‘But perhaps it isn’t the same Mr. Johnson,’ says Mrs.
Mayne. ‘It ’ud be a pity for the maid to give up her
husband if there was any mistake.’</p>

<p>“‘I know Longwood in California,’ says Jim, ‘as well as
I know my own hand. I was there only last fall. ’Tisn’t
a very big place, an’ I knowed every one as lives there. I
knowed Samuel Johnson well—he come to chapel reg’lar.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
I reckon,’ says he, ‘the name o’ the minister as recommended
him was Ebenezer Strong.’</p>

<p>“‘E-es,’ says Tamsine, ‘that’s the name. The Reverend
Ebenezer Strong.’</p>

<p>“‘That’s it,’ shouts Jim. ‘Why, he’s a coloured man
hisself—he wouldn’t be likely to find fault wi’ the man for
bein’ a nigger. You mustn’t ha’ no more to do wi’ him, my
girl. ’Twas a mercy I met ye, and could warn ye in time.’</p>

<p>“‘Oh! but what can I do?’ cries the poor maid, a-sobbin’
fit to break her heart. ‘There’s not a bit o’ use in
my goin’ back. None of ’em would believe the tale. My
uncle would make me go all the same, I know.’</p>

<p>“‘E-es, to be sure,’ says Maria Robbins, looking at Jim
very sour-like; ‘’tisn’t very likely as Mr. Meadway ’ud be
put off by a chance tale from a stranger. There he’ve
a-been at the expense o’ gettin’ everthin’ ready for the
maid, and this ’ere gentleman what writes so straightforward
an’ sends the money so handsome, may be some
quite other Mr. Johnson. I mind,’ says Maria, ‘the time
o’ the Crimee War, Miss Old went into deep black for
some chap called John Old, what got killed out abroad,
and what she reckoned was her brother, an’ ’twasn’t him
at all.’</p>

<p>“‘Samuel Johnson, o’ Longwood, is a nigger,’ cries Jim,
smacking his hands together. ‘His grandfather was a
slave. He belonged to some queer old gentleman what
gave ’en the name to start wi’, ’cause ’twas the name of
some old ancient chap what wrote a book or some such
thing; an’ this chap was named for him Samuel Johnson
too. There ain’t no mistake, you bet,’ says he.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>“Well, Tamsine was a-cryin’ and a-shakin’ all over like
a aspen leaf all this time; and when Maria was advisin’
her to be sensible an’ not hearken to them sort of idle
tales, I thought she’d ha’ had a fit. I could ha’ laughed
any other time to hear wold Maria, as was so dead
again’ the girl marryin’ when she thought ’twas a nice
match, an’ now she was all for her doin’ it, though she
seed how skeart the poor maid was. Mrs. Mayne had a
softer heart.</p>

<p>“‘If this be really true, Jan,’ she says, lookin’ at I, ‘it
do seem a pity for the maid to go any forrarder. Better
for her to stay at home and go to sarvice,’ says she.
‘There, Tamsine, give over cryin’. Nobody can force ye
to go to America or to take up wi’ this ’ere nigger against
your will. Go back an’ tell your uncle what you’ve
a-heard, an’ let him keep ye a bit longer till ye’ve a-got a
situation.’</p>

<p>“‘Oh, I dursn’t go back,’ says poor Tamsine. An’ then
Jim reaches towards her and takes her by the hand again.</p>

<p>“‘Look here, my dear,’ says he, ‘don’t go back. Ye
can go out to America,’ says he, ‘but it needn’t be to
marry that dirty nigger. I’m going back to the States
now,’ says he, ‘and I thought to take a wife wi’ me, but
the maid I was coortin’ drew back at the last. She didn’t
think so much of her word seemingly as you do. Come,’
says he, ‘you’ve seen me an’ you haven’t seen Samuel
Johnson. Look me in the face and tell me if you think
you could put up wi’ me?’</p>

<p>“The poor maid she was that upset, and that surprised,
she couldn’t for the life of her look at ’en, an’ he leaned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
over an’ took her by the chin, very gentle-like, an’ turned
up her face.</p>

<p>“‘Look at me, my dear,’ says he, ‘an’ see if ye can
trust me.’</p>

<p>“So at that Tamsine did look at ’en, wi’ the big tears
standin’ on her eyelashes, an’ her mouth all a-quiverin’.</p>

<p>“‘I d’ ’low I could,’ says she.</p>

<p>“‘And, mind ye,’ goes on Jim, ‘I can make ye just so
comfortable as t’other chap ’ud ha’ done. I’ve got a big
place and a comfortable house, and I do want to settle
down reg’lar. So say the word, my dear,’ says he.</p>

<p>“‘Lard, maid!’ cried Maria, so sudden-like that we all
fair jumped, ‘whatever be ye thinkin’ on?’ says she; ‘’tis
plain what he’ve made up this cock-an’-bull story for now,’
she says. ‘He be a reg’lar deludin’ deceiver; don’t ye ha’
nothin’ to say to ’en.’</p>

<p>“‘It do seem very sudden,’ says Mrs. Mayne; ‘I
wouldn’t go out to America wi’ a stranger, Tamsine.’</p>

<p>“‘Do you trust me, my dear?’ says he, looking at Tamsine,
and not takin’ no notice at all of nobody else.</p>

<p>“The maid she looked back at ’en more pitiful than
ever, an’ then she did say:—</p>

<p>“‘I d’ ’low I do.’</p>

<p>“‘Well, then, so ye may,’ says he, a-shakin’ of her hand
very serious like; ‘but I’ll make all fair and square for ye
first. I’ll not ax too much of ye. We’ll be man and wife
before we go,’ says he.</p>

<p>“So the whole thing was made up wi’out no more trouble
nor that. Jim axed Mrs. Mayne if the maid could lodge
wi’ her till they was married, an’ he settled straight off
what he’d pay for her board. He did pull out a pocket-book<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
stuffed wi’ money, so as even Maria Robbins could
see the maid was a-doin’ well for herself.</p>

<p>“‘You hand me over that there money as Johnson sent
ye,’ says he to Tamsine; ‘he must have it back by the
next mail. I’ll look after ye now,’ says he. ‘My purse is
your purse.’</p>

<p>“An’ though the man could scarce ha’ meant it, for I
d’ ’low he was too sensible a chap to hold wi’ settin’
women-folk so much above theirselves as that ’ud shape to,
’twas a handsome thing for ’en to say. Well, Tamsine
went to lodge wi’ Mrs. Mayne, for she couldn’t no ways
make up her mind to go back to her uncle; an’ she did
beg us all not to say a word about the changin’ her
plan till the weddin’ was over, but Maria, she did go
straight off to Meadways’ wi’ the tale. They were all in
a terrible takin’ at first, an’ Mrs. Meadway she came to Mrs.
Mayne’s an’ gave her an’ Tamsine a bit of her mind—more,
I d’ ’low, on account of the maid not goin’ back to
their place than for her takin’ up wi’ another man. ’Twas
bringing disgrace on her family, says she.</p>

<p>“Poor Tamsine was in a terrible way, when in walks
Jim Taylor, an’ what he said an’ what he did I couldn’t
tell ye, but he managed to pacify them all. Meadways all
come to the weddin’, an’ Jim was so taken up wi’ Tamsine’s
little brothers and sisters, that he took two of ’em
out wi’ ’en an’ sent for the others some time after. I d’
’low he’d ha’ cut off his head for Tamsine.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s the end o’ the tale. Ye’ll agree ’twas a
bit queer—the queerest thing as ever did happen to I,
though, as I do say, Whitefoot an’ me have a-seen many
queer things in our time.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">MRS. SIBLEY AND THE SEXTON.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was Christmas Eve, and Mrs. Fry was returning home
from Branston with a bulging pocket and a piled-up
market-basket. Clinging to her skirts was the youngest
baby but one, while Selina, her eldest daughter, trundled
along the “pram,” the occupant of which was almost
smothered amid parcels of various shapes and sizes. The
intermediary members of Mrs. Fry’s family straggled
between the two, all very clean and tidy and all beaming
with good humour. Stanley, indeed, evinced a propensity
to tumble into the gutter every now and then, while
Wyndham and ’Erbert occasionally delayed the advance
of the procession by playfully sparring at each other almost
beneath the perambulator wheels. The little <i>cortège</i> made
slow progress, for, as Mrs. Fry laughingly observed, it was
the hardest job in the world to get a big little family
home-along; nevertheless, the general serenity remained
undisturbed. It was pleasant enough to loiter on this fine
dry afternoon, for the air was clear and crisp, and the
roads clean and hard as iron. Even the baby cooed and
chuckled as it squinted upwards at its sister from behind
the whitey-brown parcel which reposed on its small chest.</p>

<p>The party at length turned off from the high road, and
was proceeding tranquilly down the “dip” which led to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
the small group of cottages of which the Frys’ home made
one, when from the farmyard gate on the right a tall
woman emerged carrying a jug of milk.</p>

<p>“Be that you, Mrs. Fry? I stepped over to your place
an hour ago, but there was no one at home.”</p>

<p>“We all comed out to do a bit o’ Christmas shoppin’,
Mrs. Sibley, d’ye see. But I’m sorry I missed ye. Will
ye step in and have a drop o’ tea wi’ us? Selina will hurry
on and get it ready.”</p>

<p>“No, thank ye,” returned Mrs. Sibley gloomily; “I’ll not
go in now, Mrs. Fry—not when all your family’s about.
I was a-lookin’ for a word wi’ ’ee confidential-like. I was
a-wantin’ for to ax your advice, Mrs. Fry.”</p>

<p>“Oh, and was ye?” said Mrs. Fry, much impressed.
“Tell ’ee what—I’ll send the childern home wi’ ’Lina an’
I’ll step in to your place, Mrs. Sibley, my dear. But all
Foyle’s family ’ull be there, won’t they?—there’ll not be
much chance to talk private.”</p>

<p>“There will, though,” returned Mrs. Sibley. “I sent the
childern out wi’ their father a-purpose. Things is gettin’
serious, Mrs. Fry; but there! I can’t converse out here.
Best let the matter bide till we be safe in my house.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Fry hastily detached the small chubby hands of
Halfred—she had a pretty taste in nomenclature—who
was clinging to her skirts, and desiring the child to run
home-along wi’ ’Lina, gave her undivided attention to her
neighbour.</p>

<p>“Not here,” said Mrs. Sibley impressively, as she began
to ply her with questions; “at my house.”</p>

<p>They turned aside into the first cottage of the group, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
Mrs. Sibley, opening the gate, stalked in front of her crony
along the flagged path, and flung open the house-door.
Pausing in the middle of the kitchen, she added emphatically,
“In Foyle’s house I should say.”</p>

<p>“It be the same thing, bain’t it?” returned Mrs. Fry
cheerfully, “or like to be soon.”</p>

<p>“Be it?” said Mrs. Sibley witheringly. “Be it,
Martha?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Fry set down her market-basket, and dropped
into the nearest chair.</p>

<p>“Lard, my dear, you do make I feel quite nervish. Be
things a-goin’ wrong?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Sibley folded her arms, and surveyed her for a
moment in silence. She was an angular woman with a
frosty eye, which she now fixed grimly on Mrs. Fry.</p>

<p>“I don’t say as they be a-goin’ wrong,” she remarked
after a pause, “but they don’t seem to be a-goin’ right.
Foyle, there, he haven’t got the spirit of a mouse.”</p>

<p>“Hasn’t he said nothin’—nothin’ at all?” inquired
Mrs. Fry, resting a plump hand on either knee and leaning
forward.</p>

<p>“Not a single word,” replied her friend; “that’s to say,
not a word wi’ any sense in it. An’ Sibley have been gone
six months now, mind ye.”</p>

<p>“So he have!” replied Mrs. Fry. “An’ ye mid say as
you’ve been so good as a widder for nigh upon six year—ye
mid indeed. A husband what’s in the ’sylum is worse
nor no husband at all. An’ ye’ve a-been keepin’ house for
Foyle these four year, haven’t ye?”</p>

<p>“Four year an’ two month,” responded Mrs. Sibley.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
“There, the very day after Mrs. Foyle were buried he did
come to me an’ he says so plain-spoke as anything, ‘Mrs.
Sibley,’ he says, ‘here be you a lone woman wi’out no
family, an’ here be I wi’ all they little childern. Will ’ee
come an’ keep house for I an’ look after ’em all? Ye’ll not
be the loser by it,’ he says. So I looks him straight in the
face: ‘I bain’t so sure o’ that, Mr. Foyle,’ I says. ‘I do
look at it in this way, d’ye see. A woman has her chances,’
I says. ‘I don’t think Sibley ’ull last so very long—they
seldom does at the ’sylum—an’ then here be I, a lone
woman, as you do say. I mid very well like to settle
myself again; an’ if I go an’ bury myself so far away from
town in a place where there’s sich a few neighbours, I don’t
see what prospects I’ll have.’”</p>

<p>“Well, that was straightforward enough,” commented
Mrs. Fry. “He couldn’t make no mistakes about your
meanin’.”</p>

<p>“He could not,” agreed Mrs. Sibley triumphantly; “an’
what’s more, he didn’t. He up an’ spoke as plain as a
man could speak. ‘Well, Mrs. Sibley,’ he says, ‘there’s a
Fate what rules us all.’ He be always a-sayin’ off bits o’
po’try an’ sich-like as he gets from the gravestones, ye
know.”</p>

<p>“Ah,” remarked Mrs. Fry nodding, “being the sexton,
of course, it do come nat’ral to ’en, don’t it?”</p>

<p>“‘There’s a Fate what rules us all,’ he says,” resumed
Mrs. Sibley, “‘an’ we didn’t ought to m’urn as if we had
no hope. If you was a free ’ooman, Mrs. Sibley—well, I’m
a free man, and I’d make so good a husband as another.
Maria did always find I so,’ he says.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>“Well, the man couldn’t have said more.”</p>

<p>“So you’d think. But why don’t he say summat now?
There, I’ve a-kept his house an’ seen arter his childern for
more nor four year. Time’s gettin’ on, ye know; I bain’t
so young as I was.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Fry began a polite disclaimer, but was overruled
by the other.</p>

<p>“I bain’t—’tisn’t in natur’ as I could be. I wer’ gettin’
a bit anxious this year when poor Sibley did seem to be
hangin’ on so long, so I axed Rector to have ’en prayed
for——”</p>

<p>“A-h-h-h?” ejaculated Martha, as she paused. “An’
that did put the Lard in mind of ’en, I should think.”</p>

<p>“It did put the Lard in mind of ’en,” agreed Mrs. Sibley
with gusto. “The Lard see’d he warn’t no good to nobody
in the ’sylum, an’ so he wer’ took.”</p>

<p>“An’ Foyle have never come forward?” remarked Mrs.
Fry, after a significant pause.</p>

<p>“He’ve never made no offer, an’ he’ve never said a single
word to show he were thinkin’ o’ sich a thing. Not <i>one
word</i>, Mrs. Fry. I’ve given ’en the chance many a time.
A month arter poor Sibley was buried I says to ’en,
‘Here be I now, Mr. Foyle,’ I says, ‘a widow ’ooman, the
same as you be a widow man’.”</p>

<p>“An’ what did he say?” queried her neighbour eagerly.</p>

<p>“Oh, summat about the ’opes of a glorious resurrection,”
returned Mrs. Sibley scornfully. “An’ another time I
says to ’en, ‘Mr. Foyle,’ I says, ‘d’ye mind the talk what
you an’ me did have when you first did ax I to keep
house for ye?’ ‘What talk,’ says he. ‘Why,’ I says,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
‘about me bein’ free an’ you makin’ a good husband.’
‘Free,’ says he sighin’; ‘this life’s a bondage, Mrs. Sibley.’
An’ off he went.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” commented Mrs. Fry, “he wer’ thinkin’ o’
them verses what’s wrote on old Farmer Reed’s tombstone.
I mind they do begin this way:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">‘This life is but a bondage,</div>
<div class="verse">My soul at last is free.’”</div>
</div></div>

<p>“That’s it,” agreed Mrs. Sibley nodding. “I says to
’en this marnin’, ‘Mr. Foyle,’ I says, ‘the New Year’s a-comin’,
an’ I think there ought to be some change in the
early part of it for you an’ me.’ ‘I don’t want no changes,’
he says; ‘I’m very well satisfied as I be.’ I’m gettin’
desperate, Mrs. Fry.”</p>

<p>“Well, ’tis very onconsiderate,” returned Martha, “very.
I’m sure ye’ve said all ye could an’ done all ye could. ’Tis
hard, too, for a woman to have to go a-droppin’ hints an’
a-takin’ the lead in such a delicate matter. I’m sure I
don’t know what to advise, my dear.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Sibley rubbed her nose, and gazed at her friend
meditatively.</p>

<p>“I’m about the only ’ooman in this ’ere place as Foyle
could get to keep house for him,” she remarked. “I’ll tell
’ee what I’ll do, Mrs. Fry—I’ll march! Leastways,” she
added, correcting herself, “I’ll tell ’en I be goin’. We’ll
see how he’ll like that.”</p>

<p>“Ye mid try it,” said Martha reflectively; “it ’ud be a
bit ark’ard, though, if he was to take ’ee at your word.”</p>

<p>“He’ll not do that,” returned Mrs. Sibley, continuing
emphatically: “Now, Mrs. Fry, my dear, I’ll expect ’ee to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
act the part of a friend by me. If he do ax ye to lend ’en
a hand or send over Selina to help ’en, don’t ye go for to
do no such thing.”</p>

<p>“I won’t,” promised Mrs. Fry.</p>

<p>“An’ if he do say anything to ’ee about my leavin’, do
ye jist let on as my mind be quite made up.”</p>

<p>“I will,” said Mrs. Fry.</p>

<p>“I’ll start packin’ at once then, to show ’en as I be in
earnest,” said Mrs. Sibley, with a dry chuckle as her friend
rose.</p>

<p>No sooner had Mrs. Fry edged through the narrow door
with her market-basket than Mrs. Sibley set to work.</p>

<p>When Mr. Foyle, who united the double functions of
carrier and sexton, unhitched the horse from his van, and,
having seen to the animal’s comfort, went indoors, he was
surprised to find his children, who had preceded him into
the house, standing with scared faces round the packing-case,
which occupied the centre of the kitchen, while Mrs.
Sibley, with an air of great determination, was stowing
away various articles therein.</p>

<p>“Hullo!” cried he, pausing in the doorway. “What’s
the matter here? Isn’t tea ready?”</p>

<p>“You’d best put on the kettle, Florence,” said Mrs.
Sibley, turning to the eldest child. “I haven’t had
time to ’tend to it. Oh, be that you, Mr. Foyle? Would
you kindly hand me down that there clock? I’m afeard
the childern mid break it. Henery, just roll up that
door-mat an’ fetch it here.”</p>

<p>“Dear heart alive, what be about, Mrs. Sibley?” ejaculated
honest Foyle. “You haven’t had no bad noos, I
hope?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>“Oh, no noos at all, Mr. Foyle. Nothin’ noo do never
come a-nigh this ’ere place. I be goin’ to have a bit of a
change—I did tell ’ee this marnin’ as I wanted a change,
didn’t I? I be a-goin’ to shift, Mr. Foyle.”</p>

<p>“To shift!” ejaculated the sexton.</p>

<p>He slowly unwound the lengths of black and white comforter
which were swathed about his neck, gaping at her
the while.</p>

<p>“You’d best make tea, hadn’t you?” remarked Mrs.
Sibley, ostentatiously counting over the plated spoons
which were her property. “Florence ’ud very likely scald
herself.”</p>

<p>The sexton dropped heavily into the nearest chair.</p>

<p>“Ye bain’t goin’ away to-night!” he gasped.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sibley straightened herself and eyed him reflectively.
It might be a little awkward to say she <i>was</i> leaving
that night, for if by chance he <i>did</i> take her at her
word, she had not the remotest notion of where she could
go.</p>

<p>“Not to-night,” she said at length, with the air of one
making a concession. “I reckon to-morrow ’ull be time
enough.”</p>

<p>Florence laid down the teapot and approached, her eyes
round with consternation.</p>

<p>“Ye’re never goin’ to leave us on Christmas Day!” she
ejaculated. “Oh, Auntie!”</p>

<p>“Auntie” was the title unanimously bestowed on Mrs.
Sibley by the young Foyles, and accepted by that lady
pending its exchange for a more intimate one.</p>

<p>In a moment Florence burst into tears, and the other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
children immediately followed suit, little Rosanna being
indeed so overcome by her feelings that she was constrained
to lie on the floor and scream.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sibley stooped over her and set her on her feet.
Beneath her stiff and somewhat chilly demeanour she had
a warm enough heart, and was sincerely attached to her
charges, particularly the youngest, whom she had brought
up from infancy.</p>

<p>“Ye’ll have to get another Auntie, my dear,” she remarked,
winking away a tear. “And ’tis to be hoped as
she’ll take as good care of you as I’ve a-done.”</p>

<p>The sexton breathed hard, but did not venture to protest,
and Henery, after rubbing his eyes on his jacket sleeve,
inquired in a reproachful tone why Auntie was going away.</p>

<p>“I wants a change, my dears,” reiterated Mrs. Sibley,
bestowing a gentle shake on Rosanna, as a means of
bringing her round, for the child, following her favourite
mode of procedure when her feelings were too many for
her, was rapidly growing black in the face. “I did tell
Father so this marnin’—Father knows. He bain’t surprised,
I’m sure. What must be, must be!” summed up Mrs.
Sibley oracularly. Thereupon casting an inquiring eye
round the room, she descried the warming-pan, which was
hanging behind the door, pounced upon it, and stowed it
away in the packing-case on top of the hearthrug.</p>

<p>Silence reigned for some moments, broken only by the
sobs of the children and the rustling of Mrs. Sibley’s
packing-papers.</p>

<p>“Ye’d best give the children their tea, Mr. Foyle,” she
remarked, looking up presently. “They be in need of it,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
poor things. There, don’t ye cry so, Florence. Ye’ll be
gettin’ another Auntie soon—at least, I hope so. Though
reelly I don’t quite see who ye can call in, Mr. Foyle, I
don’t indeed. I passed the remark to Mrs. Fry to-day, an’
she said she was sure she didn’t know who you could turn
to. Her own hands was full, she said. Poor ’Lina was
worked a deal too hard for a maid of her age, already.
Them was her words. But sit down to your tea, do, Mr.
Foyle. Get the bread, Florence; ’tis time for you
to be growin’ handy. ’Tis you as ’ull have to be keepin’
the house most like.”</p>

<p>It might have been the result of Florence’s emotion, or
it might have been owing to the fact that the shelf was a
high one and Florence’s arms were short, but in some way
or other in reaching down the loaf she managed to tumble
it into the coal-box.</p>

<p>Foyle rose hastily, pushed the child on one side, picked
up the loaf, dusted it with his sleeve, set it on the table,
and went out, banging the door behind him.</p>

<p>As the sound of his retreating footsteps echoed down
the path, Mrs. Sibley rose to her feet and smiled upon the
children, who were now sobbing afresh.</p>

<p>“There, don’t ye make such a fuss,” she remarked
soothingly. “Father’s a bit upset; ye mustn’t mind that.
Get on with your teas, dears. There, ye may have a bit
of jam to it to-night, as it’s Christmas Eve; and afterwards
we’ll stick up some green, and you must all hang up your
stockin’s and see what you’ll find there in the marnin’.”</p>

<p>Cheerfulness was immediately restored; little faces grimed
by tears smiled afresh; plates were extended for plentiful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
helpings of blackberry jam, and soon little tongues were
gleefully discussing the morrow’s prospects, and particularly
the treasures which might be looked for in the
stockings.</p>

<p>“But I’ve only got such a ’ittle stockin’,” lisped Rosanna,
contemplating a chubby leg, which was, indeed, but imperfectly
protected by about three inches of sock. “My
stockin’ won’t hold half so much as the others.”</p>

<p>“There, I’ll lend you one of mine, then,” said Auntie,
graciously; and, going to the chest of drawers in the
corner, she drew forth a pair of her own substantial stockings,
and presented one to the child.</p>

<p>As the children retired for the night, Henery paused
beside her for a moment.</p>

<p>“You won’t truly go to-morrow, Auntie?” he pleaded
coaxingly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sibley paused a moment, and in the interval the
sound of the sexton’s slouching step was heard without,
and his hand fumbled at the latch.</p>

<p>“It do all depend on Father, Henery,” said Mrs. Sibley,
raising her voice slightly. “He do know very well as I do
want a change.”</p>

<p>Mr. Foyle entered, looking weary and depressed, and
sat down in his customary chair. Mrs. Sibley cast a
searching glance round the kitchen, and, possessing herself
of a pair of spotted china dogs which adorned the
mantel-piece, added them to her collection, and retired.</p>

<p>The sexton lit his pipe, and had been smoking in gloomy
silence for some time, when Mrs. Sibley re-entered. Going
to the dresser, and opening a drawer, she abstracted a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
number of oranges, nuts, crackers, and other such wares,
and filled her apron with them.</p>

<p>“What be them for?” inquired the sexton diffidently.</p>

<p>“Why, they be surprises for the childern,” returned
she.</p>

<p>“Ah,” rejoined John Foyle, “surprises, be they?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mrs. Sibley, “they do look for ’em reg’lar,
they do. I do always fill their stockin’s wi’ ’em every
Christmas.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said the sexton, “put their surprises in their
stockin’s, do ’ee?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Sibley nodded and withdrew, leaving John sunk in
profound thought.</p>

<p>“This ’ere be a vale o’ tears,” he remarked presently, as
he knocked the ashes out of his pipe. He rose, went to
the table, turned up the lamp a little more, and fetching
pen, ink and paper from the window-sill on which they
usually reposed, sat down to indite a letter. It cost him
much labour and thought, but, after all, it was a brief
enough document. When completed it ran thus: “If Mrs.
Sibley will meet Mr. Foyle in the churchyard to-morrow
morning about nine o’clock when nobody’s about she will
hear of something to your advantage. Yours truly, John
Foyle.”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t,” said the sexton to himself, “put the question
in any sort of public way. The childern is in and out,
and the neighbours mid pop in. The churchyard is best
and most nat’ral.”</p>

<p>He folded the letter, put it in an envelope, and addressed
it; then, looking round, descried hanging over a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
chair-back one of Mrs. Sibley’s stockings—the fellow to
the one she had lent little Rosanna.</p>

<p>“The very thing!” exclaimed John. “The Christmas
surprises do always go in stockin’s. It’ll be a surprise for
she, I d’ ’low—not but what she didn’t look for it,” he
added with a grim chuckle.</p>

<p>He placed the letter in the stocking, fastened it securely
with a loop of string, and, going cautiously upstairs, slung
it over Mrs. Sibley’s door-handle. He paused a moment,
winking to himself, and then made his way on tiptoe to
his own room.</p>

<p>The usual Christmas bustle and excitement prevailed in
the little household next morning. The children ecstatically
compared notes over their fruit and toys; the sexton
himself was quite unaccountably jovial, with a nervous
kind of joviality nevertheless, hardly venturing to glance
in Mrs. Sibley’s direction. She, on her side, wore a
sedate, not to say chastened, aspect, and was attired in
her deepest “weeds”.</p>

<p>Foyle’s jocularity diminished after a time, and he set
off for the churchyard in a depressed and uncomfortable
frame of mind. What was the woman driving at—what
more in the name of goodness could she want?</p>

<p>He paced up and down the path nearest the gate for
some time, and then, suddenly recalling the fact that he
had not yet attended to the stove connected with the
heating apparatus of the church, hurried off to accomplish
this duty.</p>

<p>On his return he descried a tall figure in black making
its way, not towards him, but towards that portion of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
churchyard wherein reposed the mortal remains of the
lamented Mr. Sibley.</p>

<p>After some hesitation the sexton followed, and Mrs.
Sibley, having deposited a wreath of evergreens on the
grave, turned round with a mournful expression.</p>

<p>“At such times as these, Mr. Foyle,” she remarked, “the
mind do nat’rally feel m’urnful.”</p>

<p>“True, true!” agreed the sexton uncomfortably.</p>

<p>“He was a good husband, Mr. Foyle,” said the widow
in a melancholy tone.</p>

<p>“To be sure,” said John doubtfully.</p>

<p>“I shall never look upon his like again,” resumed Mrs.
Sibley, shaking her head.</p>

<p>The sexton glanced from her disconsolate face to the
wreath of evergreens, and then back again. Mrs. Sibley
was still shaking her head with an air of gentle resignation.</p>

<p>“I think I’ll be goin’,” said Mr. Foyle with sudden desperation.
“I thought you did step out to this ’ere churchyard
with another intention.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Sibley glanced at him in mild surprise.</p>

<p>“Ye didn’t chance to get no letter this marnin’, I
s’pose?” continued the sexton with some heat.</p>

<p>“A letter!” repeated Mrs. Sibley.</p>

<p>“E-es, the letter what I did put in your stockin’ for a
surprise,” added John emphatically.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sibley’s melancholy vanished as by magic; she
smiled on the sexton, not only affably, but positively
coyly.</p>

<p>“An’ it <i>was</i> a surprise!” she exclaimed, “it <i>was</i> indeed.
E-es, Mr. Foyle.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>She paused again, and then, all scruples apparently
vanquished by the delicacy of John’s attitude, she extended
a bony hand from beneath the folds of her black
shawl.</p>

<p>“That’s why I’m here,” she said.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE CALL OF THE WOODS.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Monday</span>.—Even to the most casual observer the day of
the week would have been announced by the appearance
of the rambling village; the new-budding hedges were
remorselessly weighted with household gear, fresh from the
tub; the very grassplots were whitened with the same;
but the gooseberry bushes were as yet unadorned with
extraneous trophies, for as every one knows, a thrifty rustic
housewife relegates the washing and “getting up” of fine
things to Tuesdays.</p>

<p>The orchard of that popular house of entertainment,
known as “The Three Choughs,” the weather-beaten sign
of which bore the partly obliterated presentment of a
triplet of birds unknown to naturalists—the orchard of
“The Three Choughs,” I say, was no exception to the
general rule. From the gnarled branches of pear- and
plum-tree depended many wavering tokens of Mrs.
Cluett’s industry; the clothes lines were weighted with the
like; and Alice, her rosy-cheeked daughter, went periodically
to and fro from wash-house to hedge with a basket
poised on one sturdy hip, or, for the sake of variety, set
jauntily aloft on her curly head.</p>

<p>The bar was left to take care of itself; at that hour
callers were unlikely. Noontide was past, evening had not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
yet come; if any stray wagoner or chance bicyclist were
in need of refreshment he had but to uplift his voice, or to
knock on the worn panels of the door leading from the
taproom to Mrs. Cluett’s private premises. Many succeeding
generations of knuckles had, indeed, removed the last
vestige of paint from the panels in question, and indued
them with a fine mellow tint of their own.</p>

<p>Nevertheless Mrs. Cluett was enjoying herself so much
in the midst of her suds, so thoroughly absorbed in soaping
and kneading and wringing, that such a summons was
thrice repeated without effect; and it was not until Alice,
returning from one of her expeditions to the hedge, chanced
to glance casually at the taproom window that the impatient
customer contrived to attract attention.</p>

<p>Seeing a man’s face peering discontentedly through
the latticed panes, and hearing a corresponding voice repeatedly
shouting, Alice set down her basket and hurried
into the house.</p>

<p>“We don’t often have no one callin’ at this time o’
day,” she remarked with a pleasant smile, by way of
greeting.</p>

<p>The man gave his order for a pint of beer without
noticing the intended apology, and dropped into one of
the wooden chairs allotted to customers.</p>

<p>Alice glanced at him askance as she set jug and glass
before him. A tall young fellow, not more than twenty-five,
with a face browned by sun and wind till it was as
dark as a gipsy’s, thick, black hair, good features, and the
strangest eyes that the girl had ever beheld in a human
face. They were like hawk’s eyes, keen and clear, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
with that fixed, far-away look peculiar to the eyes of a
bird or beast of prey. Yet the man’s face was not a cruel
face, and by-and-by, meeting Alice’s questioning gaze, he
smiled hesitatingly.</p>

<p>Alice was a good girl, and had always been well looked
after by her mother; but it was part of the business of
life, as she conceived it, to enter frankly into conversation
with all who chanced to need refreshment at “The Three
Choughs;” and she was interested in each, from the oldest
customer to the latest and most casual caller.</p>

<p>“Where be come from?” inquired Alice, now propping
herself against the lintel of the door, and surveying the
stranger with undisguised curiosity.</p>

<p>He wore corduroys and leggings, and yet was no gamekeeper;
he carried a small bundle and a sturdy stick, but
she felt sure that he was not a tramp.</p>

<p>He jerked his thumb over his shoulder, looking at her
for a moment before replying; his words came at last
slowly, as though he were unused to much speech.</p>

<p>“Yonder,” he said, “Chudbury way.”</p>

<p>Alice glibly ran through the names of several villages,
with an interrogative pause after each, and the newcomer
shook his head in every case, without, however, further
attempting to enlighten her.</p>

<p>She stopped at length, evidently at a loss, and the man,
setting down his glass, laughed suddenly, a joyous, good-humoured
laugh, pleasant to hear.</p>

<p>“You be fair beat, my maid,” said he. “But I do ’low
you’d not be so very much the wiser if I was to tell ’ee.
I be come from Tewley Warren—that’s where I be come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
from.” He dropped his voice and his face clouded over.
“That’s where I’ve a-lived all my life,” he added.</p>

<p>“Why have ’ee left now, then?” inquired Alice.</p>

<p>“I didn’t leave o’ my own free will—ye mid be sure o’
that,” said he.</p>

<p>Alice looked up inquiringly, and he continued after a
pause, still slowly and somewhat hesitatingly, as though
he found it difficult to lay hold of the words he needed.</p>

<p>“I did live there wi’ my wold father; and when he
shifted to the New House, Squire wasn’t willin’ for I to go
on a-livin’ there. He did want our place for one o’ the
keepers—a married man wi’ a fam’ly—he didn’t hold, he
said, wi’ lettin’ a young chap, same as I, bide there—he
did turn I out—to speak plain.”</p>

<p>“Oh—h,” said Alice commiseratingly. “’Twas a bit
hard, I d’ ’low.”</p>

<p>“It was mortal hard,” said he.</p>

<p>He raised the tumbler of beer to his lips, but set it down
again untasted.</p>

<p>“To give Squire his due,” he said, “he did offer to keep
I on for the same money what I did have when the wold
man were livin’, but I wouldn’t have it. ‘No, sir,’ says I,
‘I bain’t a-goin’ to be takin’ orders in the place where I
did use to be my own master’—’twas jist same as if I
was my own master when my father were alive; he didn’t
never interfere wi’ I, poor wold chap.”</p>

<p>It was perhaps Alice’s fancy that a momentary dimness
veiled the hawk eyes—in any case it was only momentary.</p>

<p>“So here I be,” summed up the ex-warrener conclusively.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>“Here you be,” echoed Alice; then, after a moment’s
pause: “What be goin’ to do now?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said the man.</p>

<p>“Where be goin’ to?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” he said again.</p>

<p>At this moment Mrs. Cluett’s voice was heard calling
aloud for her daughter; that lady’s heavy foot presently
sounded in the narrow passage without, and she burst into
the room.</p>

<p>“Dear, to be sure! Did ever a body see such a maid?
Us so busy and clothes not half done wi’! And here ye
must stand gawkin’ and gossipin’ as if ’twas the middle of
the week. There, drink up your beer, do, good man, and
let’s ha’ done wi’ it.”</p>

<p>She addressed these words to the newcomer in a somewhat
softened tone, and he nodded good-humouredly.</p>

<p>“All right, missus; I’ll not be long now,” he said, as he
poured out his second glass.</p>

<p>“There, for shame, mother, let the poor soul take his
drink in peace,” whispered Alice. “He’s come far—from
Tewley Warren; he’ve a-been turned out now his father
be dead.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Cluett, with a soapy hand on either hip, surveyed
the young man curiously.</p>

<p>“I did use to know Warrener Baverstock well,” she remarked
slowly. “Warrener Baverstock up to Chudbury—e-es—I
did use to know en.”</p>

<p>“He were my father,” remarked the other, with a momentary
gleam of pleasure in his eyes.</p>

<p>“He did use to come here often and often,” continued<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
Mrs. Cluett, emphatically. “He’d sit there—as mid be
where you be a-sittin’ now—and he’d take his glass, he
would; a most respectable man he were. My poor husband
were alive too in them days—ah, times is changed, bain’t
they? Here be I, a poor widow woman wi’ my own livin’
to get, tho’ there’s them as did ought to be gettin’ it for I
in my ancient years.”</p>

<p>She paused to shake her head. Young Baverstock’s
attention seemed to have wandered during the latter part
of her speech, and he sipped his ale without evincing any
curiosity as to the hint she had recently thrown out. After
the manner of her kind, however, she at once proceeded to
elucidate it.</p>

<p>“’Tisn’t as if I didn’t have somebody as did ought to be
a-doin’ for I. There’s my son—a big, strong, hearty chap—my
right hand he did use to be—there’s a deal to be
done about this here place, ye know.”</p>

<p>“I do ’low there is,” agreed Baverstock absently.</p>

<p>“’Tisn’t only the public,” she continued, “tho’ I d’ ’low
it be a bit hard for two women to have to manage all they
menfolk—but there’s a bit of a farm to be seen to. Well,
when I say a farm I do mean a couple o’ cows and a few
pigs and chicken and that; and we do always grow our
own spuds and greens, you know, and a few ranks o’
roots to help out wi’ for the cows in the winter. A man
be wanted for all that kind o’ work, and it do seem hard
as I should have to throw away my dibs to strangers
when I mid have my own flesh and blood a-workin’ for
nothin’.”</p>

<p>“It do,” agreed Baverstock, this time with more attention.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
“Why don’t your son do it then?” he inquired
after a pause.</p>

<p>“Why?” repeated Mrs. Cluett in a tone of deep disgust.
“Because he’ve a-been and gone and got married—that’s
why, the unnat’ral fellow,” she added witheringly.</p>

<p>The young man surveyed her without hazarding a remark;
those strange eyes of his remained as impassive as
ever, but the corners of his mouth turned slightly upwards.</p>

<p>“I warn’t a-goin’ to let en bring his wife here,” continued
the old woman. “I didn’t never fancy her, and ’twas
again’ my will he did take up wi’ her. ‘You don’t bring
her here,’ I says.—‘Then I don’t stop here,’ says he. ‘All
right, my lad,’ says I, ‘ye can march!’ So he marched.
He be a-workin’ over to new brewery now—down in the
town.”</p>

<p>Baverstock apparently considered that this communication
called for no comment; at all events he made none.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cluett, who had wrought herself up to the point of
exposing the full extent of her grievances, was no whit
abashed by his silence, however, and continued excitedly.</p>

<p>“The menfolk—there! they do seem to think a poor
lone ’ooman fit for nothin’ but to make a laughin’ stock on.
Dear heart alive, ’tis enough to drive a body silly! Us
can’t seem to find a decent civil-spoke chap nowheres, can
us, Alice? The minute a thing is not to their likin’ up
they comes wi’ their sauce and their impudence, and off
they goes.”</p>

<p>The young man gazed at her with an increasing interest:—</p>

<p>“You be short-handed now, then, be ye?” asked he.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>Mrs. Cluett threw back her head with an ironical laugh.</p>

<p>“Short-handed! We be, so to speak, wi’out no hands
at all. The last boy as worked here marched off o’
Saturday. Turned up his nose at his good victuals, and
answered I back when I spoke my mind to him about it.
I’m sure I don’t know where to look for another. And
the ’taters bain’t all in yet, and there’s such a deal to do
in this here place.”</p>

<p>Adam Baverstock pushed back his chair and gazed at
her for a moment reflectively.</p>

<p>“I do ’low I mid serve your turn so well as another,”
said he, in a calm and impartial tone, as of one in no way
concerned in the issue.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cluett surveyed him dubiously, but Alice surreptitiously
nipped her mother’s elbow.</p>

<p>“Do seem to be a likely chap,” she murmured.</p>

<p>Still with the judicial air befitting one about to conclude
a bargain, Mrs. Cluett put various questions to the would-be
assistant, her countenance brightening perceptibly as she
ascertained that he had some knowledge of the management
of cows, his father having kept one during the latter
years of his life, that he knew all about pigs, that he didn’t
care what he turned his hand to, and that he was by no
means particular in the matter of wages.</p>

<p>“I don’t seem to know what to do next,” he explained.
“I mid be lookin’ about me here, and I could fill in the
time till you can light upon a man to your likin’. There’s
one thing,” he added with that flicker of the lip which
Alice had noted before, “I bain’t one as ’ull ever give ye
impudence—I bain’t one as cares for much talk—I bain’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
used to it, d’ye see. The wold man and me—there!
There was weeks when we didn’t so much as give each
other the time o’ day.”</p>

<p>“Dear, to be sure! To think o’ that now,” said Alice,
whose tongue was wont to wag pretty freely. “Wasn’t it
terr’ble lonesome for ye?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t ever feel it so,” returned Adam, “there’s a deal
o’ company in the woods, and company as don’t want
talkin’ to,” he added with a laugh.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cluett now proceeded to enter into practical details.
Adam’s bundle contained, it seemed, all his worldly goods,
a large wardrobe having been considered unnecessary in
Tewley Warren, and such few sticks of furniture as the
old man possessed having been purchased by his successor.
He was therefore unhampered by any great need for space
in his new quarters; yet he looked round the attic assigned
to him with a clouded face, noting which, his mistress sarcastically
inquired if he didn’t find it big enough.</p>

<p>“Oh, ’tis big enough,” he returned; “big enough if a
man can breathe in it.”</p>

<p>He opened the tiny casement, and looked out:—</p>

<p>“I can see one tree,” he exclaimed, in a tone of relief.</p>

<p>“And what mid ye want with trees?” she inquired.
“You won’t need to be lookin’ out much when ye’ve a-had
a proper good day’s work.”</p>

<p>And thereupon, informing him that it was time to
“sarve pigs,” and directing him as to the whereabouts of
the meal-bucket, she descended to her own long neglected
wash-tub.</p>

<p>Alice, however, still lingered in the passage, and observed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
that, as Adam took off his coat preparatory to
setting to work, he paused, with an odd little laugh to
himself.</p>

<p>“I was near forgetting you,” said he, peering into one of
its capacious pockets and apparently addressing something
inside.</p>

<p>“What have ye got there?” inquired Alice.</p>

<p>Adam carefully hung up the coat on a nail, thrust his
hand into the pocket aforesaid, and produced a very small
rabbit—a little furry ball with downy semi-transparent ears
and bright beady eyes.</p>

<p>“I had to bring he along of I,” he explained, as he
stroked the little creature which sat quite contentedly in
his brown palm.</p>

<p>“How did you make en so tame?” asked Alice.</p>

<p>“I’ve had en nigh upon a week now. ’Tis thanks to I
he warn’t made a stoat’s breakfast on. They stoats—they
be terr’ble varmint. I be always on the look-out for ’em.
Well, this here little chap was bein’ dragged along by a
big ’un when I chanced to spy the pair of ’em. I made
an end of Maister Stoat and I did take the little ’un home-along.
He couldn’t feed hisself, poor little thing, but we
made shift, didn’t us, little ’un? There, he can drink out
of a teaspoon so sensible as a Christian.”</p>

<p>“Do ’ee let I give en a drap o’ milk now,” cried Alice
eagerly.</p>

<p>The little rabbit justified his owner’s proud assertion,
and after refreshing himself in the manner indicated, was
comfortably stowed away in a hay-lined basket.</p>

<p>“I were pure glad to bring he along of I,” said Adam,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
for the nonce communicative; “he’ll mind me o’ the
woods, d’ye see. And I’ve a-brought these, too.”</p>

<p>Thrusting his hand inside his waistcoat he brought out
a few young fir shoots, green and tender, and deliciously
aromatic as he bruised them with his strong fingers.</p>

<p>“Smell!” he exclaimed, thrusting them suddenly under
Alice’s pretty little freckled nose.</p>

<p>She sniffed, and remarked without enthusiasm that it
was a nice smell enough.</p>

<p>“There’s n’ar another like it,” said Adam gruffly; and
replacing them in his bosom he strode away to attend to
the wants of the pigs.</p>

<p>Decidedly the new man-of-all-work at the Three Choughs
was a queer fellow; all who came to the place agreed in
this estimate of him. He worked well, but yet, as Mrs.
Cluett frequently averred, as if “he didn’t have no heart
in it”; he was steady, civil, and obliging enough, but so
silent, so unaccountably silent, that the regular visitors to
the little inn could make nothing of him.</p>

<p>The only person who could ever induce him to talk was
Alice Cluett, and then it was at rare moments, and upon
odd, and, to her, uninteresting topics.</p>

<p>One evening he called out to her excitedly as she was
crossing the little yard, declaring that he smelt the dew.</p>

<p>Alice paused beside him, inhaling the sweet air of the
spring dusk with inquiring nostrils.</p>

<p>“They’ve a-been mowin’ over t’ Rectory to-day,” said
she, “I see’d gardener gettin’ the machine out—’tis the first
time this spring. ’Tis the cut grass what you do smell
I do ’low.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>“Nay,” cried Adam eagerly, “’tis the dew. Who’s to
know it so well as me, my maid? Haven’t I stood and
smelt it time and again yonder in the woods at Chudbury?
’Tis the dew on the young leaves and the noo grass. I
used to tramp it down, and then stan’ still to smell it. The
Warren must be lookin’ fine now.”</p>

<p>Even in the dusk she could see his eyes dilate, and that
tell-tale mouth of his curl upwards.</p>

<p>“And there’s scarce a tree to be seen here,” he sighed
presently.</p>

<p>“Lard,” said practical Alice, “what a man you be,
Adam! There’s plenty o’ things more worth lookin’ at
than trees, I d’ ’low. There’s fields wi’ the crops comin’
on so nice, and the river, and the road wi’ all the folks’
traps an’ carts and wagons, and there’s the gardens wi’
flowers and ’taters and everything, and there’s men and
women, an’—an’ maids,” she added, tilting her chin saucily.</p>

<p>Adam brought back his eyes from the distant vision
upon which they had been feasting to another vision nearer
at hand, and his face relaxed.</p>

<p>“Ah, there’s maids,” he agreed. “I never knowed any
maid afore I knowed you, Alice. There’s times when——”</p>

<p>He broke off suddenly.</p>

<p>“There’s times when—what?” she inquired with interest.</p>

<p>“I could a’most be glad sometimes that I did come away
from the Warren,” said he. “I’m glad to know ye, Alice.”</p>

<p>“Oh, and are ye?” rejoined she with a somewhat
tremulous laugh.</p>

<p>“E-es,” returned Adam reflectively, “I’ve see’d maids
now and then when I did use to come down to buy a few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
little oddments in the town, but I never took no notice of
them—I never knowed any of them. I be glad to know
you, Alice.”</p>

<p>Alice made no answer. She picked a leaf from the
hedge and chewed it. Had it not been so dark Adam
might have noticed the sudden rush of colour that overspread
her face.</p>

<p>“The chaps hereabouts do often seem to go out a-walkin’
wi’ maids,” resumed Adam. “I were a-thinkin’—you and
me mid go a-walkin’ sometimes.”</p>

<p>“We mid,” she agreed.</p>

<p>“Sunday, maybe?” suggested Adam, with a sudden
note of exultation in his voice. “If you could get off for
a good long bit, Alice, we mid step up to Oakleigh Woods.
I haven’t been there yet, but they do tell I they’re
splendid.”</p>

<p>“They’re nice enough,” said Alice, somewhat dubiously.
“We’ll have to see what mother says,” she added.</p>

<p>“Do ye ax her then,” suggested Adam.</p>

<p>Alice moved away from him, and glanced back over
her shoulder.</p>

<p>“Maybe I will,” said she.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cluett, on being consulted, was at first doubtful
and inclined to be irate.</p>

<p>“This do seem like coortin’,” she remarked severely.</p>

<p>Alice twisted the corner of her apron without replying.
It certainly did look rather like courting.</p>

<p>“Be you and that chap thinking o’ bein’ sweethearts?”
resumed Mrs. Cluett.</p>

<p>Alice raised defiant dark eyes: “’Twouldn’t be no such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
very great harm if we was,” she returned. “He be a
likely chap, Adam be; he’ve a-got a few pounds laid by,
and if him an’ me was to make a match of it you wouldn’t
need to pay en no wage.”</p>

<p>This was a practical aspect of the affair which had not
hitherto struck Mrs. Cluett; her countenance relaxed.</p>

<p>“But he haven’t axed I yet,” said Alice discreetly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cluett drew a long breath.</p>

<p>“Well I haven’t got no objections to your walking out
wi’ he on Sunday, my dear,” she remarked condescendingly;
and Alice dropped her apron and went away
smiling.</p>

<p>Sunday came, and the pair duly set forth, Mrs. Cluett
watching their departure from the kitchen window, not
without some elation, for indeed her maid was, as she said
to herself, a fine piece, and Adam, as he strode along by
her side, was “so well set-up as a granadier”.</p>

<p>Alice chattered away gaily while they walked, tucking
up her pretty blue skirt to show her starched white petticoat,
while her curly head, under its rose-crowned hat,
turned this way and that as they passed friends and
neighbours. Other heads turned to gaze after her, and
many jests and laughs were exchanged, and not a few sly
innuendos as to the possible outcome of events. Alice would
laugh and blush then, and glance surreptitiously at Adam;
but the ex-warrener was more taciturn even than usual that
day, and though his face wore a contented expression, he
appeared to take little heed of his surroundings.</p>

<p>Presently the girl became silent, and by-and-by distinctly
cross; she lagged a little behind Adam; once or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
twice she stumbled, and once paused, having tripped over
a stone.</p>

<p>“What be to do?” inquired Adam, bringing down his
eyes all at once from the horizon, where the irregular parti-coloured
lines of Oakleigh Wood had hitherto held his gaze.</p>

<p>“You do walk so fast,” complained Alice, “and the road
be so rough—and—” in a still more aggrieved tone—“all
the other boys and maids what we do meet be a-walkin’
arm-in-crook.”</p>

<p>“Come,” said Adam diffidently, “us can do that too, I
suppose.”</p>

<p>Alice curved her arm, and he, after a little practice, supported
her elbow in the recognised fashion prescribed for
courting-folk. He looked down at her with a softened
expression as they advanced afresh.</p>

<p>“Be enjoying of yourself, my maid?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“E-es,” returned Alice dubiously. “Be you?”</p>

<p>“Jist about!” said Adam, at which she brightened
visibly.</p>

<p>They now turned off the dusty road that for the last
half-mile had climbed up almost perpendicularly, with the
downs rolling away on one side and a carefully enclosed fir
plantation skirting it on the other. A sheep-track that
presently lost itself, wound away over the downs between
patches of grass and low-growing thorn and elder bushes
to where Oakleigh Wood spread its exquisite, undulating
length invitingly before them. Adam quickened his pace;
his whole face lightened and brightened in a manner of
which it had not hitherto seemed capable; presently he
began to sing in a rich ringing joyous voice, and Alice,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
clutching at his arm to stay his progress, exclaimed in
amazement:—</p>

<p>“You do seem quite another man to-day!” she cried
half petulantly.</p>

<p>“I d’ ’low I be another man,” answered he. “Let’s run,
maidie, let’s run. Let’s get there.”</p>

<p>He caught her by the hand, and the girl, infected by
his excitement, raced with him at her topmost speed. Off
they flew over the springing turf and only paused, laughing,
when they reached the shelter of the belt of firs which
stood at the outskirts of the wood. The cool green fragrance
was refreshing after that breathless race in the fierce
sunshine; Alice’s eyes were dancing and her heart leaping,
but Adam had suddenly become grave again; when he
spoke it was in a subdued voice almost as if he were in
church, the girl thought. Nevertheless he looked very
tenderly at her as he touched her lightly on the shoulder.</p>

<p>“Now, maidie,” said he, “I be goin’ to show ye such
things as ye did never see in your life—I be a-goin’ to let
ye into a few of the secrets o’ this place.”</p>

<p>“Ye’ve never been here yourself afore,” protested Alice.</p>

<p>“I know ’em all the same,” returned Adam. “I do
know all about woods. A squirrel, see! Look yon.”</p>

<p>“Where?” whispered Alice.</p>

<p>“On the big crooked branch there. Keep still, and
he’ll come nigh us.”</p>

<p>As they stood motionless the little creature did indeed
come frolicking downwards from bough to bough, pausing
to glance at them, leaping away in feigned terror, returning
for closer inspection, then, evidently deciding that they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
were not, and could never have been, alive, and were, in
consequence, not dangerous, sitting up, chattering, a yard
or two above their heads. He was presently joined by a
friend, or it might be a rival; a lively discussion ensued, a
mad scamper, a protracted chase, the two finally disappearing
in the inner depths of the wood.</p>

<p>“Let’s go,” said Alice.</p>

<p>She had been amused and interested, but felt nevertheless
somewhat disappointed. This was the strangest courting
she had ever heard of: it seemed hardly worth while
to have walked three miles on a Sunday afternoon merely
to watch the antics of a couple of squirrels. But Adam
was perfectly happy; for the first time since he had left
the Warren he found himself in his element and at ease.</p>

<p>“If you do know how to treat ’em, birds and beasts is
tame enough,” he remarked. “There, the very varmint
’ull be friendly wi’ you. There was a wold weasel yonder
in the Warren what did use to have reg’lar games wi’ me.
He knowed I were arter him, d’ye see, and he were that
cunnin’ he did lead I a dance for months and months. I
do ’low the creature ’j’yed it. When I did take en out o’
the gin at last he did grin up in my face as if he were a-sayin’
‘ye be upsides wi’ me at last, wold chap!’—I could
a’most have found it in my heart to let him go, but I
dursn’t, along o’ my father. Hush, look!”</p>

<p>A green woodpecker was climbing up the tree near
which they had halted; the pair watched him until he
took wing, and then pursued their way. Alice’s heart was
sinking more and more; she yawned once or twice in a
frank, undisguised way, and walked ever more slowly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>“Hark!” cried Adam jubilantly, “the cuckoo. ’Tis the
first time I’ve heard en—he be late to-year.”</p>

<p>“Have ye got any money about ye?” inquired Alice
eagerly. “Turn it round quick, if ye have.”</p>

<p>“What for?”</p>

<p>“Why, for luck, sure. Didn’t ye know that? You
must turn your money first time you do hear cuckoo cry
so as you’ll have plenty more to-year.”</p>

<p>Adam’s fingers dropped from the waistcoat pocket where
they had been vaguely fumbling.</p>

<p>“What’s money to me?” he muttered, as, with head
thrown back and brows frowning with eagerness, he followed
the course of certain black specks which at that
moment were flying high over the wood.</p>

<p>“Wild duck!” he remarked presently.</p>

<p>Alice turned on him in desperation.</p>

<p>“Well, I be a-goin’ for to sit down,” she remarked.
“I’ve a-brought a bit o’ summat to eat wi’ me.”</p>

<p>She produced from the little basket which she had carried
sundry slices of cake which she offered to Baverstock.</p>

<p>“I did bring seed-cake a-purpose because you did say
you liked it best,” she observed in an expectant tone. But
Adam’s dark eyes continued to rove even while he ate,
and his only response was inconsequent enough:—</p>

<p>“Don’t it taste good out o’ door?”</p>

<p>Alice edged away from him and munched in silence,
and presently tears of mortification welled into her eyes.
Adam, returning on tiptoe from a cautious expedition to
inspect a nuthatch’s nest in the bole of a tree, suddenly
took note of her woeful expression, and paused aghast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>“What be cryin’ for, maidie?” he asked in so kind a
tone, that the tears rolled down upon her cheeks, and a
little unexpected sob burst forth.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” she murmured; then, petulantly: “I
wish I hadn’t come!”</p>

<p>Adam’s face fell.</p>

<p>“Don’t ’ee like being here? I thought ye’d be so
pleased.”</p>

<p>The sense of injury now overcame maidenly reserve.</p>

<p>“You do never say a word to I. You don’t so much
as look at I. I mid be a stock or a stone,” she added
passionately.</p>

<p>Adam surveyed her with dawning comprehension; during
the silence that intervened the rustling of the leaves
could be heard, the distant notes of a lark circling upwards
from the downs beyond the woods, the chirp of nestlings,
the irrepressible laughter of a gleeful squirrel. Perhaps all
this cheerful bustle of the sunshiny spring awoke in
the man’s breast certain hitherto dormant instincts. He,
too, was young, and love and springtime go hand-in-hand.
He stooped, laid a tentative forefinger gently under Alice’s
round chin, tilted it slightly, and gazed down into the
tearful eyes.</p>

<p>“Ye mustn’t cry, my maid,” said he, and then he kissed
her.</p>

<p>They came out of the wood as the sun was sinking,
hand-in-hand as before, but walking sedately now, and
with a glow upon their faces other than the glow which
was dyeing the fir-boles crimson, and making the gorse
flame.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>Alice was in the seventh heaven, and as for Adam, perhaps
he too had learnt a new secret in the greenwood,
the existence of which had been hitherto unguessed.</p>

<p>“Well?” said Mrs. Cluett as the couple parted by the
yard door.</p>

<p>“Well,” returned Alice, with a conscious laugh.</p>

<p>“You do seem to be gettin’ along,” pursued the mother.</p>

<p>“E-es, we be gettin’ along,” conceded Alice, but no more
would she say.</p>

<p>She was subsequently forced to own to herself, however,
that they did not get on very fast. Adam was incomprehensible
to her, and frequently exasperating; and more
than once he seemed puzzled and irritated by things that
Alice said and did. Mrs. Cluett, for her part, blamed
them both with equal impartiality. Now she would aver
that Alice was a simpleton, now that Adam was a fool.
Was the thing to be or was it not to be? she wanted to
know; even if it was to be Mrs. Cluett was not sure that
she cared so very much about it; but if it was not to
be, there was no manner of use in Alice wasting her
time.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the couple walked together frequently, talked
little, and quarrelled more than once. On that warm June
night, for instance, when Adam, rolling himself in his
blanket, stretched himself in the orchard to sleep under
the stars, Alice’s indignation was to the full as great as
her mother’s; while the day the girl refused Adam’s offer
of pine-cones for her fire, on the ground that they popped
like pistols and smelt of turpentine, her lover’s resentment
had flashed forth in words fierce and strong.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>“You do never seem to care for the things what I like,”
he summed up.</p>

<p>To each the other was an unknown quantity; the
mutual attraction was almost counterbalanced by a shyness
begotten of the knowledge of being misunderstood.</p>

<p>The crisis came one summer’s night—a night long remembered
in the village, for there broke such a storm
over the land as had not been known, the old folks said,
since the days of their childhood. A brooding and oppressive
stillness reigned at first, and then came lightning
that seemed to split the heavens, and thunder that roared
like a thousand menacing cannons. Alice sat crouched in
a corner with a face as white as a sheet and her fingers in
her ears; and Mrs. Cluett hurried round the house, closing
doors and windows, and fastening shutters. As she was
about to shut the door leading to the yard, a sudden flash
revealed to her a motionless figure standing without, a few
paces away.</p>

<p>“Dear heart alive! ’Tis never you, Adam.”</p>

<p>She had seen his face transfigured in the momentary
gleam, the eyes exultant, the lips parted in rapture.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it grand?” came Adam’s voice, tremulous with
excitement, as the darkness enfolded him once more, and
the mystic artillery crashed over their heads.</p>

<p>“The chap’s daft!” exclaimed Mrs. Cluett. “Come in
this minute. You’ll be struck dead afore me eyes. We
don’t want no carpses in the house, do us, Alice?”</p>

<p>But Alice made no response.</p>

<p>“Lard save us!” ejaculated Mrs. Cluett, as a new flash
lit up all the surrounding country, revealing the cattle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
huddled together in the adjacent fields, the hedges, the
trees, Adam’s face, eager, enraptured, as before. She
darted out and seized him by the arm.</p>

<p>“Come in, I tell ’ee,” she cried. “I’ll not have ye
standing there no more.”</p>

<p>As he turned towards her half-dazed, she dragged him
in, and had shut and bolted the door before he recovered
his wits. The air was stifling inside the house; the paraffin
lamp reeked; the gusts of storm-wind which arose every
now and then puffed volumes of acrid wood smoke down
the chimney.</p>

<p>“A man mid choke here,” growled Adam.</p>

<p>“To bed wi’ ye then!” cried Mrs. Cluett indignantly.
“Us be a-goin’ too—’tis late enough.”</p>

<p>She took up the lamp as she spoke, and roused Alice by
a jerk of the sleeve. Adam went creaking upstairs, and
threw himself dressed upon his bed. The atmosphere of
his little attic-room, sun-baked as it had been through all
that breathless day, was like that of a furnace; he felt his
brain reel and was oppressed almost to suffocation. The
storm continued, flash after flash playing on his narrow
window; he could see the tip of his one fir-tree, now
motionless, transfixed as it were, now swaying in a puff of
wind that died away as suddenly as it came.</p>

<p>The house was very silent now, and permeated by the
odour of Mrs. Cluett’s recently extinguished lamp. Adam
sat up gasping. He thought of the Warren—of the close-growing
trees stretching away about the free and happy
man who dwelt beneath them. Once he, too, had stood
with the woods wrapping him round, and the stars of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
heaven over his head. Tewley must look grand to-night.
As he thought of it the dark shadowy forms of the trees
seemed to press upon him; he could hear their deep
breathing, and share their expectancy.</p>

<p>Ha! there was a flash. How it would light up the
beeches and play among the pines. Now the thunder! it
would roar and reverberate among those billowing trees.
The rain would come soon. First there would be a rush
of wind, and ash and oak and beech would rustle and
shiver, and the larches sway down all their slender length.
And then, while the trees were bending and rocking, the
rain would come—the cold, heavy, glorious rain. Adam
caught his breath as he thought of it—how it would come
down, hissing among the leaves, splashing on the hot
ground! How good the wet earth would smell, every
strand of moss and fibre of grass adding its own spicy
fragrance.</p>

<p>He leaped from his bed and almost at the same moment
the tree outside his window was caught by a whirling wind
and snapped. Then something seemed to snap, too, in
Adam’s brain and he laughed aloud. What was he doing
there, in that suffocating room, when he was free to go
that moment, if he chose, to Tewley Woods? What
should hold him back—what should keep him? If he
made haste he might yet reach the Warren in time for the
rain.</p>

<p>In another moment he was out of the house, and when
the next flash of lightning came it revealed a flying figure
scudding along the whiteness of the road.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>Alice cried bitterly over the defection of her wild man
of the woods, but she consoled herself in time, and took a
mate more to her mind, a practical person who sowed
cabbages in the flower-border, and considered the view of
the new brewery the finest in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>But Adam Baverstock had passed for ever out of her
life; as silently as he had come from the shadow of the
trees into the spring sunshine, so had he vanished in the
summer storm.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE HOME-COMING OF DADA.</h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">I knew</span> he was bound to be one of the first,” said Mrs.
Bunce triumphantly. “Why, he’ve a-been out there ever
since the war broke out. Two year and seven month
he’ve a-been there—and the hardships he’s been through,
and the fightin’ he’s done! There, I can’t think how ever
the Government had the heart to keep en out so long.”</p>

<p>“There’s others what have been out jist same as he
have,” returned her neighbour plaintively. “My Jan now—such
a good boy as he be, too!—well, he’ve a-been out
there months and months, and he’ve a-been in hospital!”</p>

<p>“As for fightin’,” put in the shrewd-faced little man
who formed the third party to the discussion, and whose
opinion carried weight in the neighbourhood, for his vocation
of carrier enabled him to pick up many items of news
during his daily round, “as for fightin’, Mrs. Bunce, I don’t
mean to make little o’ your husband, but there bain’t
nothin’ wonderful about him doin’ a lot o’ fightin’. They
all done that—’twas what they were sent out for, and not
a bit more credit to any of ’em nor for me to go joggin’
along behind the wold horse here.”</p>

<p>Both women reddened, and turned upon him angrily.</p>

<p>“If ye do think such things, ye did ought to be ashamed
to say ’em,” cried Mrs. Andrews. “’Eroes—’tis what they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
be every man of ’em, Mr. Bright; and you did ought to
know it, seein’ as ’twas wrote up plain over the very Corn
Exchange the day as peace was declared. ‘All Honour
to Our ’Eroes,’ it said, in them little coloured lamps so
’andsome as it could be; and bain’t there a song about
‘they’re ’eroes every one’?”</p>

<p>“And I’m sure ye can’t say,” chimed in little Mrs.
Bunce, nodding her curly head emphatically, “as it be the
same thing for a man to sit snug in his cart behind the
quietest old harse in Darset as it is to leave your wife and
your home and—and everything, and to go riskin’ your life
among Boers and Blacks in them wild parts out abroad.”</p>

<p>“E-es,” agreed her neighbour, making common cause
with her against the enemy, “e-es, indeed, Mrs. Bunce.
And your little boy wasn’t so much as born when his
dada was took away, was he? Many a time, I dare say,
you did think to yourself as he’d never see the face of his
child. I d’ ’low he thought the same hisself goin’ off, poor
fellow! Ye’ll agree that was a bit hard on the man, Mr.
Bright, so little credit as ye be willin’ to allow our soldiers.
Ye’ll agree ’twas hard on the man to go off, leavin’ his
missus to get through her trouble alone, and the child the
first child, too, mind ye.”</p>

<p>“If it had been the tenth you wouldn’t pity him so
much,” said the carrier, with a dry chuckle. “There’s
some as don’t think so much o’ them things. Jim Marshall,
now—says I to Jim t’other day, ‘Jim,’ I says, ‘I
hear you’ve got an increase to your family’; and poor
Jim, he looks at me and says, ‘E-es,’ he says, ‘more hardship’.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>Chuckling sardonically, he gathered up his reins and
jogged on again, the women looking after him with indignant
faces.</p>

<p>As the green “shed” of his van disappeared round the
corner, their eyes by mutual accord reverted to each other,
and Mrs. Andrews laughed disdainfully.</p>

<p>“’Tis a queer cranky sort of body,” she remarked; “a
bachelor man. What can you expect?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bunce’s face was still pink with wrath, but she
smiled upon the other woman.</p>

<p>“I should think your Jan did ought to come home soon
now,” she said handsomely; gratitude for Mrs. Andrews’
timely sympathy causing her to be for the moment almost
willing to admit there might be another soldier of
some merit in the British Army besides Private William
Bunce.</p>

<p>“I’m sure I hope so,” responded her neighbour rather
dismally. “You are safe to get your husband back next
week, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“Next week,” echoed Nellie Bunce joyfully. “Yes, he
says in his last letter they was to start in a week, and I’ve
a-counted up the time, and he did ought to land at Southampton
Saturday week.”</p>

<p>“I d’ ’low ye’ll be busy gettin’ all ready for him,” said the
older woman, falling into an easy attitude with her hands
on her hips, the better to contemplate her pretty neighbour.</p>

<p>“I d’ ’low I be,” responded Nellie, enthusiastically. “I
be goin’ to give en the best welcome I can, ye mid be sure.
I be cleanin’ up the house fro’ top to bottom, and I be
goin’ to paper the kitchen. I’ve bought paper already; I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
reckon I could easy do it myself; the wall aint so very
high and the room bain’t too big neither.”</p>

<p>“’Tis a stiffish job for a woman though,” returned Mrs.
Andrews, dubiously. “If Andrews wasn’t so bad with the
lumbagey, I’d get en to lend ye a hand; but he’s that stiff,
poor man, he can scarcely so much as turn hisself in bed.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll manage,” returned Mrs. Bunce, nodding
brightly. “I’m a great one for contrivin’, and ’t’ull be
summat to tell Bill as I’ve a-done it myself.”</p>

<p>“It’ll take you all your time,” protested Mrs. Andrews,
and they parted.</p>

<p>During the ensuing days Nellie was indeed up to her
eyes in work, carrying out vigorously her plan of cleaning
and polishing the house from top to bottom. Baby Billy,
who had hitherto considered himself a person of very great
importance, found himself hustled hither and thither as he
had never been in the whole of his existence, a period
extending over about thirty months.</p>

<p>On one particular afternoon, when every washable article
in the house was in Nellie’s tub, he was bidden to play out
of doors, and finding the maternal eye less on the alert
than usual, surreptitiously opened the garden gate and
wandered to the forbidden precincts of the lane.</p>

<p>He trotted along for nearly a quarter of a mile, until he
reached a particularly delectable corner graced by a large
rubbish-heap, which he proceeded to investigate with huge
satisfaction, carrying one treasure after another over the
way, sitting down to examine it, and immediately rolling
on to his legs again to procure some yet more coveted
object.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>At last, however, he secured two prizes, than which
nothing more desirable could be imagined, and with a sigh
of satisfaction toddled for the last time across the lane
and sat down to enjoy them at his leisure. The broken
jam-pot was immediately filled with sand, while the rusty
knife, grasped by its fragmentary handle, could be used in
a variety of ways—so Billy discovered—as a spade, as a
saw, as a chopper.</p>

<p>He was engaged in mincing a dock leaf very small on a
flat stone, his mouth opening and shutting in accompaniment
to his labours, when he was suddenly hailed by
somebody who had abruptly turned the corner of the lane,
somebody who was probably on his way from the town.</p>

<p>“Hello!” cried this somebody.</p>

<p>“Hello!” responded Billy, pausing with his knife poised
in mid-air and looking up with a pair of very big and very
blue eyes. He had to tilt his head quite a long way back
to do so, for the newcomer was tall. Billy was a little
startled; to begin with the newcomer was a man, and he
was not sure that he liked men—they cracked whips sometimes,
and spoke loud and gruff, particularly when, as
occasionally happened, Billy chanced to run across the road
immediately in front of their horses; then he had funny
brown clothes—nobody that Billy had ever seen wore
clothes like that; and he had a brown face too, a face so
very, very brown that it gave his blue eyes a strange look.
Billy was secretly a good deal frightened, but being a
soldier’s son he only clutched his knife the harder and said,
“Hello!” again, as the stranger continued to look at him
without speaking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>“I rather think I ought to know you, my lad,” said the
man at last, in a queer quavering voice. “I’d swear by
that little cocked nose. What’s your name, eh?”</p>

<p>“Billy,” responded the child promptly.</p>

<p>“Right you are!” cried the man, and he caught him up
in his arms, knife and jam-pot and all. “Let’s hear the
rest of it, though. Billy what?”</p>

<p>“I want to get down,” asserted the urchin, vigorously
struggling. “I want to get down and make a pudden for
my dada.”</p>

<p>The man grimaced, and instantly set the child upon his
legs.</p>

<p>“Perhaps we’ve made a mistake after all,” he said;
“perhaps you are some other chap’s Billy. Where does
your dada live, young ’un?—tell us that.”</p>

<p>Billy had by this time squatted on the ground again,
and was once more chopping at his dock leaf. He did not
answer until the man had twice repeated his question, then
he explained.</p>

<p>“My dada’s tummin’ home. He’s tummin’ in a ship—and
a puff-puff,” he added, as an after-thought.</p>

<p>“Right you are,” cried the brown-faced man again, and
he caught him up in his arms once more and kissed him.
“I thought I’d know my little woman’s nose among a
thousand, and yours is so like it as one pea is like another.
Come, let’s go and look for mammy.”</p>

<p>Billy was at first disposed to protest, but something at
once merry and tender in the man’s blue eyes disarmed
suspicion; and when he presently found himself hoisted on
a broad shoulder, and was thus carried at galloping speed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
down the lane and through the village; when, moreover,
this self-constituted steed actually vaulted the garden gate,
and covered the tiny path that intervened between it and
the cottage door with two strides, he was not only reassured
but jubilant.</p>

<p>They could see “mammy” bending over the wash-tub
through the open kitchen door, very red in the face, very
wet and draggled as to dress, and with one end of her hair
straggling down; and the queer thing was that at sight of
her the man suddenly came to a standstill and uttered a
kind of choking cry. And then mammy turned round and
dropped the shirt she had been wringing out, and fairly
screamed as she came rushing across the kitchen. Then
laughing and crying together she flung her arms round the
brown man’s neck, heedless of the danger to which she
was exposing herself from the broken jam-pot and the
rusty knife which Billy was still brandishing; and kissed
him, and rocked backwards and forwards with him, and
seemed altogether to have taken leave of her senses.</p>

<p>After a moment’s breathless pause of astonishment,
Billy thought it time to assert himself. He dropped his
two treasures on the floor and burst into a loud wail.
Then clutching hold of the newcomer’s close-cropped fair
head, he endeavoured with all his might to pull it away
from the curly one that was pressed so close to it. And
then mammy looked up, and her eyes were all wet, but
her mouth was laughing.</p>

<p>“You mustn’t do that, sonny,” she said. “This is dada!
Dada’s come home.”</p>

<p>Billy was dumb with dismay and disappointment, partly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
at the discovery that the much-talked-of and hitherto
unimagined dada was a man, partly because he was such
a very brown man, but chiefly because he had arrived
shorn of the glories of the ship and the puff-puff which he
had understood were to accompany him. So he sat still
and rather sulky on the khaki shoulder while Private Bunce
explained how he had caught sight of the little chap, and
how he at once “spotted” him by that little nose of his,
and how disappointed he had been when for a moment he
had thought it was not his Billy after all, but some other
quite uninteresting Billy belonging to another fellow.</p>

<p>“But I found him all right,” he summed up triumphantly,
“and I found you, little woman—lookin’ tip-top
you are, just about! Lard, it do seem a mortal time since
I left you, my girl.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Bill, I meant to have everything so nice for ’ee,”
cried Nellie. “Dear, to think there’s nothin’ ready! I’m
sure I’m not fit to be seen myself.”</p>

<p>She glanced regretfully towards the wash-tub. Her
pink blouse was in there—the blouse Bill had always said
he liked—and her lace collar and the little ruffles for her
wrists. The old blue cotton gown which she wore was
not only faded and patched, but soiled and almost wet
through.</p>

<p>“You’re lookin’ just splendid though,” cried her husband.
“Why, that there’s the very gown you used to wear when
we went a-coortin’—I mind it well—that little wavy stripe.
I used to think it the prettiest thing I ever did see. And
here’s the little curl comin’ down what I used to kiss when
we was a-walkin’ down by the river.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>“Oh, Bill, is it comin’ down? I wanted to be so tidy
and nice. I reckoned ye was comin’ next week, ye know.”</p>

<p>“I come over wi’ the colonel. He come across a bit
sooner nor we expected, bein’ knocked up wi’ one thing
and another. ‘The sooner the better,’ thinks I.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” cried Nellie fervently; “the sooner the
better indeed. But we be all in a caddle here. There, the
window curtains and the best table-cloth and the very bed-quilt
is in the tub, and I haven’t got any meat in the
house! I thought Billy and me ud go a bit short this
week, so’s to have a reg’lar feast when you did come
home. And—and——”</p>

<p>“Now, don’t you fret, old girl; we hadn’t no table-cloth
nor yet bed-quilts out on the veldt. And as for
meat—blowed if I do care so very much for meat. But I
tell ye what I would like.”</p>

<p>“What?” cried Nellie breathlessly.</p>

<p>“What I would like more nor any earthly thing,” said
Bill emphatically, but with a twinkle in his eye, “is just
’taters—’taters done wi’ a bit o’ drippin’, hot and tasty, the
way you did often do ’em.”</p>

<p>Nellie drew a long breath of relief.</p>

<p>“Them’s easy got,” she said jubilantly, but almost immediately
her face fell again. “It do seem a poor kind
o’ welcome,” she murmured, “and I——”</p>

<p>Private Bunce deposited his son and heir upon the
floor, the better to bestow a really satisfactory embrace
upon the little sunburnt woman. She was exceedingly
damp and smelt very strongly of soap, but he did not
seem to mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>“Now, look here,” he said, “you couldn’t give I a better
welcome nor what you’ve a-done. This here’s home—home
as I did so often think of and long for; and here
you be, my wold ’ooman, lookin’ just same as ever—just
same as I so often seed ye in my mind, and I used to
dream about ye many a time, and wake up and find mysel’
lyin’ on the sand. This here’s home and this here’s my
little ’ooman—and I don’t want nothin’ else, wi’out it’s this
young shaver,” he added as an after-thought.</p>

<p>And so, while the wash-tub steamed away unheeded in
the back premises, a very merry party sat down to an
impromptu meal. The ’taters were duly set forth, and
Nellie, cleaned up and tidy, poured out tea, and Private
Bunce cut huge slices from the crusty loaf, and declared he
hadn’t had such a blow-out, no, not since he sailed from
Southampton.</p>

<p>“To my mind, Nellie,” he cried presently, “the room
do seem to look more cheerful-like wi’out the winder curtains.
A body notices the paper more—the dear old
paper what I did stick up for ’ee myself.”</p>

<p>Nellie opened her mouth as though to speak, but changed
her mind and closed it again.</p>

<p>“I tell you what it is,” cried Private Bunce enthusiastically,
“the place wouldn’t look itself wi’out that wall-paper.
I wouldn’t have it changed for anything.”</p>

<p>Then Nellie burst out laughing and clapped her
hands.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE MAJESTY OF THE LAW.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">They</span> were cutting Farmer Fowler’s largest hayfield; it
was eleven o’clock, and the men had just “knocked off”
for the light meal known in those parts as “nuncheon”.
A big flagon of cider was being passed round from one to
the other, accompanied by goodly slices of bread and
cheese. The farmer himself stood a little apart under the
shade of a large elm which grew midway in the hedgerow
that divided this field from its neighbour, paying a half
scornful attention to the scraps of talk with which the
labourers seasoned their meal. He himself was not given
to self-indulgence, and inwardly chafed at the loss of this
half-hour from the busiest time of the day. He had
worked as hard as any of his men, and was, indeed,
hardly to be distinguished from them, except by the
better quality of his clothes. He was a tall, strong-looking
fellow, with a face as sunburnt as any of theirs, and arms
as muscular and brown. He was coatless, and wore a
great chip hat; his shirt-sleeves were rolled up above his
elbows, and his shirt was open at the throat. Two teams
of horses stood in the shadow of the hedge, plucking at
the twigs or stretching down their necks towards the grass
which they could not reach; the vast field, half cut, lay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
shimmering before him in a blaze of light; the dome overhead
glowed almost to whiteness, for the sun at this hour
was intolerably hot. Yet even as the master gazed, impatiently
longing for the moment when he could set his
hinds to work again, he saw a figure rapidly crossing the
field, looking from right to left, as though in search of
some one. It was the figure of a young woman; so much
he could divine from the shapely outline and springing
ease of motion, but her face was at first lost to him under
the deep shade of her broad-brimmed hat. She approached
the group of labourers first, and made some query in a tone
too low for him to distinguish the words. He saw his
foreman, however, turn towards the tree beneath which he
himself stood and jerk his thumb over his shoulder. Evidently
the young woman had come in search of him.</p>

<p>She made her way towards him, walking more slowly,
and indicating by her aspect a certain amount of diffidence.
A comely girl—he could see that now—dark-eyed,
dark-haired, and glowing with health and life.</p>

<p>“If you please, sir,” she began timidly, “I came—my
father sent me. It’s about the taxes.”</p>

<p>She drew from her pocket a little blue paper of familiar
aspect; the demand-note for the rates collected four times
a year by the Overseers of the Branstone Union. The
angry colour glowed in Jacob Fowler’s face as he twitched
the paper from her hand.</p>

<p>“What’s the meaning of this?” he cried; “what have
you got to do with it?”</p>

<p>“I am Isaac Masters’ daughter, of Little Branstone,” she
said hastily. “He collects the rates for our parish, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
he’s very ill in bed. He’s had a stroke, poor Father has,
and I’m doing his work for him.”</p>

<p>“He should have known better than to send you to
me,” returned Jacob, still wrathfully. “I never heard sich
a tale i’ my life. Sendin’ a maid to collect the rates!
Dally! Where will the women-folk stop?”</p>

<p>“Nobody else made any objection,” said the girl, with a
little toss of her head. “I’ve got it all right, except yours;
and Father thought I’d best come and ask for it.”</p>

<p>“Then you can tell your father as he did make a very
great mistake,” thundered Fowler. “’Tis bad enough to
be bothered about they dalled rates wi’out havin’ a woman
set up over you.”</p>

<p>He tore the paper into fragments as he spoke, scattering
them to the breeze. “There, you jist turn about and
go home-along, my maid, and tell your father that’s my
answer. If your father bain’t fit to do his work hissel’, he
did ought to get somebody else to do it for ’en—some
other man. The notion o’ sendin’ a maid! I never did
hear o’ sich a piece o’ cheek!”</p>

<p>The girl, without waiting for the end of his indignant
commentary, had turned about as he had advised, and
was now walking swiftly away, her head held very high,
angry tears on her thick lashes. Jacob impatiently jerked
out his watch; it wanted still ten minutes of the time
when work would have to be resumed. He dropped the
watch into his pocket again, whistling under his breath, a
good deal out of tune. Once more fragments of the men’s
talk reached his unwilling ears.</p>

<p>“That be Bethia Masters, that be—a wonderful good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
maid. They d’ say the wold man ’ud be fair lost wi’out
her. The Parish Council did give her leave to take his
place for a bit so long as there was a chance he mid get
better.” “She be a shapely maid and a vitty one.”
“E-es, she’s well enough; looks a bit tired now, walkin’ i’
the heat three mile here and three mile back.” “E-es,
and a sarcin’ at the end o’t,” chuckled one old fellow under
his breath. “Our maister, he did gi’ ’t to her! I heerd
’en. Our maister bain’t partial to payin’ rates at any time,
and he didn’t reckon for to hand over his money to a
’ooman.”</p>

<p>Farmer Fowler watched the retreating figure idly; it was
true she was a shapely maid. How lightly and rapidly
she walked: ’twas a long way, too—three miles and more.
He could have wished he had not been quite so hard with
her. He might have asked her to sit down and rest for a
while; he might have offered her a glass of cider. He
almost wondered at his own outburst of irritation as he
looked back on it now, and watched the girl’s retreating
form with an increasing sense of shame.</p>

<p>The toilsome day was over at last, the horses stabled,
the men fed. Farmer Fowler was smoking the pipe of
peace in his trellised porch with a pleasant sense of weariness.
It was good to rest there under the honeysuckle in
the twilight, and to think of how much had been accomplished
during the long sunny hours which had preceded
it.</p>

<p>The sound of a light foot caused him to raise his eyes,
which he had partially closed a few moments before, and
the ensuing click of the garden gate made him sit upright<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
and crane forward his head. A girl’s figure was making
its way down the little paved path, a girl’s voice once more
greeted him tremulously.</p>

<p>“If you please, Mr. Fowler, I’m sorry to trouble you,
but——”</p>

<p>Jacob Fowler in the evening was a different person to
the Jacob Fowler of the fields; he stretched out his hand
and drew her forward by the sleeve.</p>

<p>“Sit down, my maid,” he said; “sit ye down. You’ve
a-had a longish walk, and for the second time to-day, too.”</p>

<p>Bethia came into the shadow of the porch; her face
looked pale in the dim light, and he could see the bosom
of her light dress rise and fall quickly with her rapid
breath.</p>

<p>“If you please, sir,” she began again, “I know you’ll
be vexed, but Father, he’s very much undone about the
taxes. He’ll be gettin’ into trouble, he says, if he doesn’t
send the money off to-morrow. He made me come back
and ask you again. We’d take it very kind if you’d let us
have what’s owing, sir.”</p>

<p>Her tremulous tone smote Jacob; stretching out his big
hand once more, he patted her shoulder encouragingly.</p>

<p>“There, don’t ye be afeard, my maid; don’t ye. I’ll
not bite ye.”</p>

<p>A dimple peeped out near Bethia’s lip. “You very
nearly did bite me this morning,” she said.</p>

<p>“Nay, now,” returned Jacob, smiling beneath his thick
beard, “I weren’t a-goin’ to bite ye; I was on’y barkin’,
maid. Lard, if you did know I, you’d say wi’ the rest of
’em that my bark was worse nor my bite. There! what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
about this trifle o’ money as I owe for the rates? How
much is it? Dally! I don’t know how ’tis, but it fair
goes agen me to pay out money for taxes. It do seem so
unfair when a man’s farm’s his own—land and house and
all—for Government to go and say, ‘You’ve a-got a house,
and you’ve a-got land as your father and grandfather have
a-bought wi’ their own money—you must pay out for
that, my lad; you must hand over whatever we pleases to
ax for.’ ’Tisn’t as if they’d consult a man. If they was
to say to I, ‘Mr. Fowler, you be a warmish man, and
there’s a good few poor folk up i’ the union; what be you
willin’ to allow us for them?’ I’d call that fair enough,
and I’d tell ’em straight-out what I <i>was</i> willin’ to ’low.
But no; they goes and settles it all among theirselves wi’
never a word to nobody, and jist sends out a paper wi’out
by your leave or wi’ your leave. ‘You <i>be</i> to pay so much,
whether you do like it or whether you don’t.’ ’Tain’t fair.”</p>

<p>“I dare say it isn’t, sir,” rejoined Bethia, very meekly;
“but I’m not askin’ you on account of the Government—I’m
just askin’ you for Father’s sake. He’s fretting terribly,
and the doctor says he oughtn’t to upset himself.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t mind if I do make an end o’ this here
business for your father’s sake, maidy; but I d’ ’low I’d
jist so soon do it for yours.”</p>

<p>“For mine!”</p>

<p>“E-es, because you do ask I so pretty. I did speak a
bit sharp to ye this mornin’, but it was along o’ being
vexed wi’ the Government—I wasn’t really vexed wi’ <i>you</i>,
my dear.”</p>

<p>Bethia began to laugh; her little white teeth flashed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
out in the most charming way—her bright eyes lit up.
Jacob gazed at her with increasing favour.</p>

<p>“I bain’t vexed wi’ you, my dear,” he repeated affably,
and then suddenly standing up, darted into the house. In
a few minutes he emerged again carrying a little packet,
which he handed to her.</p>

<p>“It be all there, wrapped up i’ that bit o’ paper; you’d
best count it and see as it be right. Will ye take a glass
o’ milk or summat?”</p>

<p>“No, thank you, Mr. Fowler; I’m very much obliged,
but I think I must be getting home now. It’s growin’
dark, and my father will be anxious.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t you like nothin’?” insisted Jacob. “A posy
o’ flowers or summat? There’s a-many of ’em growin’ i’
the garden, and nobody ever thinks for to pick ’em.”</p>

<p>“Of course not; a man does not care for such things, I
know. You live all alone, don’t you, Mr. Fowler?”</p>

<p>“All alone, my maid, since my poor mother died. She
went to the New House fifteen year ago. I’m what you
mid call a reg’lar wold bachelor, I be.”</p>

<p>He threw out this last remark with such an obvious
wish to be contradicted that Bethia hastened to return,
“Not so old as that, I’m sure, Mr. Fowler. My father
always speaks of you as a young man.”</p>

<p>“I be jist upon farty,” returned Jacob, with surprising
promptitude. “Farty; that be my age. Not so old for
a man.”</p>

<p>“Not at all old,” returned Bethia very politely; then,
extending her hand, “I’ll say good-night now, sir.”</p>

<p>“Won’t you have a posy, then? Do. Help yourself,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
my maid. I’ll walk a piece o’ the way home wi’ you, and
then you needn’t be afeard.”</p>

<p>“Very well, and thank you kindly.”</p>

<p>She followed him out of the porch, and up a path that
led round the house to the old-fashioned garden at the
rear, where there were roses, and lilies, and pinks, and
sweet-williams growing in a glorious medley. She uttered
little shrieks of delight, as she ran hither and thither,
breaking off here a cluster of roses, there a lily-head.
Jacob stalked silently behind her, clasp-knife in hand,
cutting ten stalks where she had culled one, until at last
a very sheaf of flowers rested in his arms.</p>

<p>“I’ll have to go all the way to carry it for you,” he
remarked in a satisfied tone.</p>

<p>Bethia turned and clapped her hands together. “Oh,
what a lot! I never thought you were going to get all
those for me. How shall I ever thank you?”</p>

<p>“I’ll carry it for you,” repeated Jacob. “This way out,
my dear; there’s a little gate jist here.”</p>

<p>A faint after-glow still lingered on the horizon, but already
the silver sickle of the young moon appeared in the
transparent sky. A bat circled round their heads from
time to time, yet some love-lorn thrush serenaded his mate
somewhere not far off, his liquid ecstatic notes filling the
air, as it seemed. Great waves of perfume were wafted to
Bethia’s nostrils as she paced along beside the farmer,
whose tall figure towered over her, the silhouette of his
face showing clear above the irregular line of hedge.</p>

<p>As they walked he questioned her from time to time, and
learned how the girl had only come back to live with her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
parents within the past year, having been absent for some
time teaching in a school at Dorchester.</p>

<p>“School-teachin’!” commented Jacob. “That be how
you do speak so nice and clear. I speak awful broad
myself—never had much eddication.”</p>

<p>“Hadn’t you?” returned Bethia, with interest.</p>

<p>“Nay, never had no time for that. My father, he died
when I were a lad, and my mother weren’t one as could
manage a farm so very well. She was a bit soft, my poor
mother, and very easy taken in. So I did put shoulder to
the wheel, and I mid say I’ve been a-shovin’ of it ever
since.”</p>

<p>“I wonder you didn’t get married, Mr. Fowler,” said
Bethia, with perhaps a suspicion of archness in her voice.</p>

<p>Jacob only grunted in reply, and an embarrassed silence
fell between them, and remained unbroken till they had
reached Little Branstone village.</p>

<p>Jacob accompanied the girl down the by-lane which led
to her home, and followed her into the kitchen; there,
however, he refused to stay, in spite of Mrs. Masters’ civil
request that he would sit down and rest.</p>

<p>“Nay,” he returned gruffly, “I’ll be gettin’ home-along
now; I only come so far to carry this here posy.”</p>

<p>Depositing his fragrant sheaf upon the table, he nodded
right and left at mother and daughter, and withdrew.</p>

<p>“Dear! Well, to be sure! Dear heart alive, Bethia,
ye could ha’ knocked I down wi’ a feather when he come
marchin’ in. Lard ha’ mercy, maidy, you be clever to ha’
got Jacob Fowler for a beau. That there man do fair
hate women of all sarts. There, he do never so much as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
look at one—and to think of him a-walkin’ all that long
ways jist for to carry them flowers! He did give you the
flowers, too, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” returned her daughter; “but you mustn’t call
him my beau, please, Mother. He only meant to be polite.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m sure he did never try to be polite to any maid
afore,” returned Mrs. Masters with conviction. “They do
say he were crossed i’ love when he were a young ’un.
Did he give ’ee the money, child?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mother, and was very nice and kind altogether.
I think he was sorry for Father when I told him how ill
he’d been.”</p>

<p>“Oh, to be sure, that’s it,” agreed her mother jocosely.
“All they flowers be for Father, too, I d’ ’low. Come, let’s
fetch ’em up to ’en.”</p>

<p>Poor old Masters, ill though he was, chuckled feebly on
hearing the marvellous tale, and expressed in quavering
tones his belief that his daughter was a-doin’ pretty well
for herself.</p>

<p>The girl, who had lived till now absolutely heart-whole,
could not repress a certain flutter of excitement, and passed
the next few days in a state of expectancy; but Jacob
Fowler gave no further sign of life. Though he appeared
at church on Sunday, he kept his face religiously turned
away from the pretty tax-gatherer’s, and at the conclusion
of the service rushed from the door without pausing to
look round.</p>

<p>Bethia bit her lip, and instead of dallying a little, as
was her custom, to chat with one or other of her acquaintance,
hastened home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>“Were Farmer Fowler there, my dear?” inquired her
mother.</p>

<p>“Yes, but he didn’t speak to me—he didn’t take a bit
of notice of me. Put that notion out of your head, Mother—there’s
nothing at all between him and me.”</p>

<p>Soon the attention of the little household was entirely
absorbed by a more acute and immediate cause of trouble:
poor old Masters, after a brave struggle, and in spite of
the adjurations of his neighbours, found himself unable to
“hold on”; he loosed his feeble grasp of life suddenly at
last, and went out, as his wife sorrowfully remarked, “like
the snoff of a candle.”</p>

<p>After the funeral was over, the question of ways and
means stared the mother and daughter in the face. Mrs.
Masters did a little business—a very little business—with
a small general shop; it was quite insufficient to support
them. Her health was not good, and Bethia was determined
not to leave her; there was no opening for her as a
teacher in that village, and such sums as she might earn
by taking in sewing would add very little to their modest
income. She resolved to make a bold appeal to the Parish
Council for permission to continue to fill her father’s place.</p>

<p>“I could do it every bit as well as a man,” she averred.
“I have done it during the last few months. The accounts
are all in order—I have found no difficulty anywhere. Do
let me try, gentlemen.”</p>

<p>The gentlemen in question were at first taken aback,
then amused, finally moved. After all, they said to each
other, there was no reason why the girl should not try.
As long as the duties were discharged exactly and punctually,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
there was no reason why they should not be undertaken
by a woman as well as by a man.</p>

<p>“But there must be no favouritism, Miss Masters,” said
one, with a twinkle in his eye; “no letting off of any
particular friend. You must be firm, even with your nearest
and dearest. If people don’t pay up after two or three
applications, you must harden your heart and take out a
summons.”</p>

<p>“I will,” said Bethia seriously.</p>

<p>In a few days the news of her installation as assistant
overseer spread through the place, one of the first to hear
of it being Jacob Fowler.</p>

<p>Bethia was standing in the kitchen shelling peas one
morning when his knock came at the door, almost immediately
followed by the appearance of his large person from
behind it.</p>

<p>“Be this here true what I’ve a-heard?” he inquired
abruptly. “Be it true as you be a-goin’ to carry on this
rate-collecting same as your father did do?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mr. Fowler,” answered Bethia, not without a
certain pride. “The Parish Council gentlemen think I
can do it just as well as anybody; and I’m glad to say
they’ve agreed to let me try.”</p>

<p>“<i>I</i> don’t agree, then,” cried Jacob violently. “It bain’t
at all fit nor becomin’ for a young ’ooman same as you to
be a-goin’ about from house to house, visitin’ folks and
axin’ them for their money. It bain’t proper, I tell ’ee.”</p>

<p>“What nonsense!” exclaimed Bethia, with a toss of
her pretty curly locks. “What’s it to you, Mr. Fowler,
anyhow?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>“I don’t like it,” growled Fowler. “Will you go and
ax folks for it, same as you did ax I?”</p>

<p>“I shall leave a little note first,” said Bethia, with a very
business-like air, “a demand-note, you know. If they
don’t pay up I shall call personally.”</p>

<p>“It bain’t the right thing for a faymale,” repeated Fowler
sourly; “least of all for a young faymale. Folks ’ull be
givin’ ye impidence.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, they won’t,” returned Bethia with dignity.
“I’m not one that anybody could take liberties with, Mr.
Fowler.”</p>

<p>He stood leaning against the table frowning.</p>

<p>“Will ye ax ’em rough-like, or will ye ax ’em civil?” he
inquired, after ruminating for a while.</p>

<p>“Why, of course I shall be civil, Mr. Fowler.”</p>

<p>“Will ye ax ’em so civil as ye did ax I?” he insisted
with a kind of roar.</p>

<p>“I’m sure I don’t know,” stammered the girl, taken
aback for a moment. “Yes,” recovering herself, “certainly
I shall. There’s no reason why I should make any difference
between you and anybody else.”</p>

<p>“You tell I that to my face! You’ll go a-speakin’ ’em
soft and a-smilin’ at ’em pretty, jist same as ye did do to
I! Dalled if I do allow it! Dalled if I do, I say!”</p>

<p>“Really, Mr. Fowler,” said Bethia with spirit, “I don’t
know what you mean. It’s very rude of you to talk to
me like that, and I do not see why you should interfere.
I shall be business-like and polite, as I always try to be
with every one, and I shall be firm too. The Law will
support me just the same as if I were a man.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>“Dalled if I do allow it,” repeated Jacob, still in a kind
of muffled bellow. “A British ratepayer I be, and have
a-been this twenty year and more, and I say I bain’t
a-goin’ to allow it. I know my rights so well as any man,
and I bain’t a-goin’ to be put upon by a ’ooman. I bain’t
a-goin’ to allow any young faymale to be took out of her
proper place and set up where she’s no business to be. I’ll
have no faymale tax-collectors a-gaddin’ about this here
parish if I can prevent it. I’ll protest, maid, see if I don’t,
and, what’s more, not one farden o’ rates will I pay into
any faymale hands.”</p>

<p>Bethia, more and more irritated by his manner, thought
it time to assert herself finally; and withdrawing her
hands from the basin of peas, and looking him full in the
face, she returned, with great firmness, “Won’t you, Mr.
Fowler? Then I’ll make you.”</p>

<p>“Lard ha’ mercy me! Listen to the maid!” exclaimed
Jacob, bursting into a fit of ironical laughter. “‘I’ll make
ye,’ says she. Look at her,” pointing at the girl’s slender
form. “That be a good un! I tell ’ee, Miss Masters,
you’ll find it a bit hard to make I do anything I’ve not
got a mind to do.”</p>

<p>Bethia took up a pod again and split it viciously. “I’ve
got the Law at my back,” she remarked.</p>

<p>“Ho! ho! ho!” chuckled Jacob, this time with unfeigned
merriment. “Listen to her! The Law at her
back indeed! Such a little small back it be! Why,
maidy, I could jist finish ye off wi’ one finger!”</p>

<p>“I’m not talking of brute force,” said Bethia, with flashing
eyes. “The Law is stronger than you, Mr. Fowler.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
Now, if you’ll kindly go away and let me get on with my
work, I’ll be much obliged.”</p>

<p>But Jacob did not take the hint. He sat down on the
table instead, and watched the girl as, with an affectation
of ignoring his presence, she moved about, filling her
saucepan at the tap, peeling the potatoes, setting them on
to boil. She did everything swiftly, deftly, and gracefully,
holding her head very erect meanwhile, and being a little
sharper in her movements than usual on account of her
inward irritation. By-and-by Mrs. Masters came creaking
down the narrow stairs, and started back at the sight
of the farmer.</p>

<p>“Dear! To be sure! I didn’t know you had visitors
here, Bethia, my dear. Won’t you sit i’ the armchair,
Mr. Fowler? Do ’ee now. I’m sure ’tis very kind o’ ye
to come a-visitin’ o’ we in our trouble.”</p>

<p>Bethia marched past her mother, removed the pot from
the fire, and carried it over to the table.</p>

<p>“Could you make a little room, if you please?” she inquired
tartly.</p>

<p>Jacob chuckled and rubbed his hands as he slowly
removed his ponderous frame; then the remembrance of
his former grievance returned to him, and he gazed at the
widow loweringly.</p>

<p>“You don’t like this here notion, Mrs. Masters, I hope?”
he inquired severely.</p>

<p>“What notion, sir?” returned the poor woman, startled.</p>

<p>“Why, this here notion o’ your daughter a-gaddin’ about
lookin’ arter the rates.”</p>

<p>“Well, you see, we be so hard pressed, we be,” faltered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
she. “My daughter do try to do her best to earn a little,
all ways she can. I’m sorry as you’ve a-got objections,
Mr. Fowler.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t in the least matter if he’s got objections or
not,” put in Bethia tartly. “It’s no concern of Mr. Fowler’s.
So long as he pays up regularly he need not trouble himself.”</p>

<p>Jacob got out of the armchair and once more approached
the table.</p>

<p>“Look ’ee here,” he said threateningly; “this here’s
past a joke. I do forbid ye for to do it—do ye hear?”</p>

<p>Bethia looked at him steadily. “I hear, and I can only
repeat what I said before. Now, Mr. Fowler, will you
please go away? I’m going to dish up.”</p>

<p>“Bethia, my dear!” protested Mrs. Masters feebly.
“There, she’ve a-got sich a spirit, Mr. Fowler, you must
excuse her. She be a bit vexed, you see, wi’ you findin’
fault wi’ her. I’m sure, the longer you stay, Mr. Fowler,
the better we’m pleased. We’ve nothin’ much fit to offer
ye, but if ye’d like to sit down and take a bit wi’ us you’re
truly welcome.”</p>

<p>Bethia shot an indignant glance towards her parent, and
Jacob stood hesitating for a moment; then with a laugh
he drew up his chair to the table.</p>

<p>“I’ll not refuse a good offer,” he said.</p>

<p>Bethia fetched a plate, knife and fork, and glass, setting
each before him with somewhat unnecessary clatter. Then
she served up the vegetables, brought out a roll of butter
and a small piece of cheese from the buttery, and took
her place in silence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>“I’m sorry,” began Mrs. Masters regretfully, “we’ve got
nothing better to offer ye, Mr. Fowler. My daughter and
me seldom eats meat of a week day.”</p>

<p>“Don’t make excuses, Mother,” interrupted Bethia, with
asperity. “Mr. Fowler knows very well that we are poor.”</p>

<p>The meal proceeded in silence for the most part, Mrs.
Masters making an occasional remark, to which Jacob
responded by a gruff monosyllable. Bethia did not speak
once, but had never looked prettier in her life; the angry
sparkle still lingered in her eyes, and her cheeks were
flushed. Whenever she glanced at the visitor her countenance
took on an additional expression of haughtiness.</p>

<p>At the end of the repast Jacob stood up. “I’d like a
word wi’ ye private, Miss Masters.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I beg pardon, I’m sure,” apologised the poor old
mother, hastening to efface herself.</p>

<p>As soon as her heavy footsteps were heard in the room
upstairs the farmer turned to Bethia.</p>

<p>“I’ve a-come to see ye friendly like,” he remarked, “and
I’ll come again. I ax ye, as a friend, my maid—will ye
gie this notion up?”</p>

<p>Bethia looked if possible more indignant than before.</p>

<p>“No, Mr. Fowler,” she returned promptly, “I tell you—as
a friend—I won’t.”</p>

<p>“Then you’ll ha’ trouble wi’ I, I warn ’ee,” responded
he, almost with a groan.</p>

<p>Jacob Fowler kept his word, and gave the poor little rate-collector
an inconceivable amount of trouble.</p>

<p>He took no notice whatever of her demand-notes and
official reminders; and when she called to see him in person,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
though he received her with civility and even undisguised
pleasure, he resolutely refused to part with a
farthing. The friendliness with which he hailed her advent,
and entered into conversation on indifferent subjects, gave
place to a rigid silence as soon as she touched on the motive
of her visit, and he would shake his head fiercely as often as
she reverted to the point.</p>

<p>One day she found him in what she took to be a softened
mood. It was in the spring, and the consciousness that it
was grand weather for potato-setting, added to the recollection
of a long and successful day’s work, had put Jacob
in an unusually good humour. He was smoking in his
porch when she drew near, and at once invited her to sit
down and rest.</p>

<p>“You do look a bit tired, my maid,” he remarked;
“tired and worried.”</p>

<p>“I am tired and worried too,” said Bethia, looking up at
him appealingly. “I’m afraid of getting into trouble, Mr.
Fowler.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Jacob, “how’s that?”</p>

<p>“They will be down on me for not sending in the
money regularly,” returned the girl tremulously; “I’ve got
it all in except yours.”</p>

<p>Jacob, instead of immediately becoming wooden of
aspect, as was his wont, gazed at her searchingly. “You’d
be all right if you was to get mine?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“Yes—oh, yes, Mr. Fowler. Couldn’t you pay up and
have done with it?”</p>

<p>Jacob shook his head, but this time apparently more in
sorrow than in anger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>“Can’t be done, my maid. I’ve a-passed my word, d’ye
see, and I be forced to stick to it.”</p>

<p>“I think you are very unkind,” said Bethia; “you are
trying to force me to give up one of the few ways I have
of making a living.”</p>

<p>“E-es,” said Jacob, “’tis true; ’tis the very thing I be
a-doin’. You said if I didn’t pay up you’d make me—well,
how be you a-goin’ for to make me?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I suppose I’ll have to send you a summons,” cried
she, with gathering anger. “’Tis my duty and I must do
it.”</p>

<p>Jacob’s face changed. The colour mounted in his brown
cheeks, and when he spoke his voice was unsteady with
surprise and wrath.</p>

<p>“You don’t mean that,” he said quickly. “You’d never
do it.”</p>

<p>“I’ll have to do it,” said Bethia, “if you force me to
proceed to extremes. Oh, Mr. Fowler,” she added, almost
passionately, “can’t you be sensible; can’t you make an
end of it once and for all? If I’d been a man instead of a
girl you wouldn’t persecute me like this. You’d think it
quite natural for me to want to take my father’s place,
wouldn’t you? What difference does it make? I can
keep the accounts, and make the applications, just as well
as any man. Why should you try to bully me?”</p>

<p>“Now look ’ee here, my maid,” said Jacob, “if you
come to that, ’tis you what be a-tryin’ for to bully I. I’ve
a-set my face again this ’ere notion. No respectable young
’ooman did ought to go a-trapesin’ fro’ one house to
t’other, a puttin’ herself for’ard and a-coaxin’ folks out o’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
their money, whether it be for the Government or whether
it bain’t. ’Tis a question between us two which can hold
out longest. Now if you was to give in to I——”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Bethia, bending forward with unconscious
eagerness, “what would happen if I were to give in to
you?”</p>

<p>Jacob took out his pipe and stared at her, and then he
got up and paced about the little flagged path.</p>

<p>“What would happen?” she repeated sharply. “What
would you advise me to do?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know,” returned Jacob confusedly. “I
haven’t had time for to think o’ that.”</p>

<p>It was now Bethia’s turn to spring to her feet. “I think
you are hard, and obstinate, and cruel! Yes, cruel, to try
and put upon my poor mother and me! But I’ll have an
end of this shilly-shally work; you shall be forced to pay,
sir.”</p>

<p>She hastened down the path. Jacob, after delaying a
moment to lay his pipe carefully in a corner of the seat,
strode after her and opened the garden gate, holding it for
a moment so that she could not pass through.</p>

<p>Bethia glanced at him. He did not look angry, but
resolute; his jaw was firmly set and his eyes steady. It
struck her forcibly that he had a good face—honest, open,
manly—and she realised with a little pang that it was
probably turned towards her for the last time in friendship.</p>

<p>“I’ll give you a month,” she said waveringly.</p>

<p>“Ye mid as well say a year,” returned Jacob. “’Twill
be all the same.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>Thereupon he opened the gate and she went away.</p>

<p>The allotted time of grace passed very slowly, and
though Bethia continued to post a little demand-note
every week, no notice was taken either of her appeal or of
herself.</p>

<p>Late on the last day of the month she was making her
way back from the town with a very melancholy face,
when, at a turn in the road, she suddenly encountered
Jacob; Jacob in holiday attire, carrying a large nosegay
of monthly roses and lilac.</p>

<p>“Hullo, my maid,” he cried genially, “well met! I
were just a-goin’ to see you.”</p>

<p>“Were you?” returned Bethia, in a very small constrained
voice.</p>

<p>“E-es, I was a-bringin’ you these here flowers. I seed
’em i’ th’ garden just now, and I thought you’d like ’em.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Fowler, you shouldn’t give them to me!”
cried the girl with a catch in her voice. “I’ve—I’ve just
been and taken out a summons against you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, and have you?” said Jacob staring at her. “Well,
that’s summat.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” returned Bethia desperately. “I waited till the
end of the month, and then I had to do it; it was my
duty. Oh, dear; oh, dear!”</p>

<p>“Well, to think on’t,” said Jacob, still apparently more
surprised than angry. “Lard ha’ mercy! That be a
pretty thing for a maid to do.”</p>

<p>“So you’d best take back your flowers,” broke out
Bethia. “I know everything’s at an end between us.
I’ve quite made up my mind to it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>“Ah,” said Jacob, eyeing her thoughtfully; “’tis queer
once folks makes up their minds how a notion will stick i’
their heads. Now all this month I’ve been a-thinkin’ and
a-thinkin’—I never was one to do a thing in a hurry—but
at last I reckoned I’d got it settled. ‘I’ll do it,’ I says,
‘I’ll ax the maid to marry I—that’ll be the best way out
of it. She’ll not want to go again’ I then,’ I says. And
you go and summons me.”</p>

<p>Bethia burst out crying. “Oh, Jacob,” she cried, “why
couldn’t you have done it before? If you had asked me
kindly—if you had told me to give up for your sake, I—I—I——”</p>

<p>She broke off, sobbing bitterly.</p>

<p>“’Tis true,” said Jacob regretfully, “I mid ha’ axed ye
a bit softer—I mid ha’ spoke a bit more kind—but you
did go and put my back up with stickin’ to the notion so
obstinate. Says I to myself, ‘So soon as ever she gives
in I’ll ax her—but she must give in’—and you wouldn’t.
So then I thought—‘Dally! I’ll ax her first and then
we’ll see.’ And then you go and put the law on me afore
I’ve time to open my mouth.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Jacob! I waited a whole month,” protested Bethia,
almost inarticulately; “and you never said anything, and
I thought you didn’t care about me, and it seemed to be
my duty.”</p>

<p>She covered her face with her hands. Jacob stared at
her for a moment, and then suddenly slapped his thigh
and burst into a roar of laughter.</p>

<p>“I d’ ’low the maid done it out o’ pique,” he cried
ecstatically, “I d’ ’low she did! She did do it along of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
her feelin’s bein’ hurt with me a-holdin’ back so long.
That’s a different story, my dear—a different story altogether!
I bain’t one to bear malice along o’ that;
’twas but nat’ral arter all. E-es, I d’ ’low I be a terrible
slow-coach; but, ye see, I’d a-got set i’ my bachelor ways,
and it did take I a long time for to make up my mind; and
then, as I do tell ’ee, I wur a-waitin’ and expectin’ for you
to give in. But I’ve spoke now, and if you’ll say the word,
my dear, all can be forgive and forgot.”</p>

<p>Bethia presumably did speak the word, for she resigned
her post as tax-collector that very evening, and she and
her Jacob were “asked in church” on the following Sunday.</p>

<p>As for that matter of the summons, it was settled “out
of court”.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel Chaffey</span> stood poised on a step-ladder nailing
up the fine Gloire de Dijon rose which was trailed over
the wall of his house. He had already performed the
same operation for the jessamine which grew over the
porch and for the purple clematis on the right of it. He
had tied his dahlias so tightly and firmly to a variety of
newly cut stakes, that each individual scarlet bloom reminded
one in some measure of a choleric old gentleman
suffering from a tight and high shirt-collar. He had
scraped the little path till the cobble-stones of which it
was composed stood revealed each almost in its entirety.
From his exalted position he could survey the whole frontage
of his own roof—a sight in which an artist would have
revelled, for not only was the thatch itself mellowed by time
and weather to the most exquisite variety of tones, but on
its mouldering surface had sprung up a multitude of blooms,
vying in brightness with those of the garden beneath—not
merely your common everyday mosses and lichens, though
patches of these were to be found in every shade of emerald
and topaz and silver, but flowers, real flowers, seemed to
thrive there; saxifrages, toad-flax, snap-dragon, and, just
where the bedroom gable jutted out, a flaming bunch of
poppies. It will be seen from this that Daniel Chaffey’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
house was an old one; it bore a date over the door, cut
roughly in the weather-beaten stone—1701. It had mullioned
windows with diamond panes, and an oaken door
studded with nails. It had indeed once been the village
schoolhouse, though the Chaffey family had been in possession
of it now for many generations, and had farmed, more
or less successfully, the small holding attached to it.</p>

<p>Daniel, himself, looked prosperous enough as he stood
hammering and whistling, and occasionally pausing with
his head on one side, and his mouth screwed up but emitting
no sound, to survey his handiwork. He was a bullet-headed
young man of about four or five-and-twenty, with
twinkling blue eyes, and a face, the natural ruddy tone of
which was overlaid by such a fine veneer of sunburn that
it was now of a uniform brick-colour. His expression was
jovial, not to say jocular; his mouth wore an habitual grin
when it was not whistling, and on this particular occasion
some inward source of jollity appeared to entertain him,
for he not only frequently chuckled but winked to himself.</p>

<p>Having inserted the last tack into the crumbling wall,
he paused, removing his hat and scratching his head
meditatively; for the first time his face wore a somewhat
serious, not to say puzzled expression, and his eyes travelled
dubiously over the flaunting array of blossoming
weeds on the roof.</p>

<p>“I wonder,” quoth Daniel to himself, “if ’twould look
better if I was to scrape out them there. Maybe the
thatch wouldn’t hold together, though—it’s a-been agrowed
over sich a-many year, I d’ ’low I’ll let ’em bide—they do
look well enough where they be.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>And, after coming to this decision, he was preparing to
descend from the ladder when he was suddenly hailed by
a chorus of voices from the lane on the other side of his
garden-hedge.</p>

<p>“Hello, Dan’l!”—“Hallo, old cock!”—“Well, bwoy,
bist getten’ all to rights afore weddin’?”</p>

<p>Daniel put on his hat and turned slowly round on his
rung.</p>

<p>“E-es,” he said, grinning sheepishly, “that’s about it.
The job’s to be done the day arter to-morrow.”</p>

<p>A party of young men had halted just outside his little
gate; it was Saturday and, though only five o’clock, their
field-work was over and they were now on their way to
the allotments; a rough, sunburnt, merry-looking group,
most of them bearing the marks of the day’s toil on
heated face and earth-stained apparel; one or two of
them with spade and fork on shoulder, others with dangling
empty sacks. September was drawing to a close and
potato-getting was in full swing. It was observable that
as they addressed Chaffey, each man assumed a knowing
and jocular air; this one nudged his neighbour, that one
winked at Daniel himself.</p>

<p>“You’m to be called home for last time to-morrow, bain’t
ye, Dan’l?” inquired Abel Bolt, elbowing himself to the
front.</p>

<p>“E-es,” responded Daniel, “we be to be called last time
to-morrow an’ tied-up o’ Monday.”</p>

<p>Abel threw back his head and laughed uproariously.</p>

<p>“I should like to come to your weddin’, Dan!” he cried
ecstatically, “I d’ ’low I should.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>“Ye won’t, though,” retorted Chaffey. “Ye’ll be jist in
the thick o’ your ploughin’—I thought o’ that. I axed
the Reverend to fix time a-purpose. No, we’ll be wed
on the quiet, Phœbe an’ me—I settled that.”</p>

<p>“There, ’tis real ill-natured o’ you, Dan,” cried one of
the youths, looking archly at his comrades. “Sich a
pretty sight as ’twill be. Sure it will! And your missus,
sich a beauty!”</p>

<p>“Haw, haw, haw!” came the chorus again.</p>

<p>“Her eyes, now,” giggled Abel, “’twill be sich a convenience
for the man to have a missus what can keep one
eye on the dinner an’ t’other on the garden.”</p>

<p>“An’ her figure,” said Jarge Vacher, “did ye have to
make the gate anyways larger, Dan?”</p>

<p>“No, there’d be no need for that,” returned Abel, before
Daniel could open his mouth. “The woman could get in
very nicely sideways, more pertick’ler since she can see
all round her like.”</p>

<p>Chaffey’s complexion had been gradually deepening from
crimson to purple, and from purple to a fine rich mahogany,
his smile had widened to an extent that was positively
painful, but he spoke with unimpaired good humour.</p>

<p>“Neighbours, you may laugh, but I do know what I’m
about. I do know very well Phœbe Cosser bain’t a
beauty, but she’s good, and I d’ ’low she’ll make I comfortable—an’
that’s the main p’int to look to. She mid
be a bit older nor what I be——”</p>

<p>Here the irreverent group in the road began to nudge
each other and chuckle afresh; Chaffey sat down suddenly
on the top of his ladder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>“What I d’ say, neighbours, is,” he began, “what my
notion be—if ye’d give over sniggering for a moment,” he
cried with gathering ire, “I could make it plain to ye.”</p>

<p>But they wouldn’t give over; the merriment increased
instead of diminishing, and at last Daniel, exclaiming that
he would be dalled if he stood it any longer, leaped to the
ground, and, dashing into his house, bolted the door
behind him.</p>

<p>His friends, trooping into the little garden, serenaded
him with a ballad which they thought suitable to his case,
and having goaded him into declaring he would come out
in a minute and break their heads for them, withdrew in
good order and pursued their interrupted course to the
allotments.</p>

<p>Daniel waited until the last heavy footfall had died away,
the last battered hat brim disappeared, and then came forth
with a vengeful expression on his usually good-tempered
face. He picked up the hammer and nails which he had
scattered in his flight, shouldered his ladder and carried it
round to the little shed in the rear, and then came back
slowly to resume his labours in the garden.</p>

<p>“She be a good ’un,” he muttered to himself, “let ’em
say what they like, she be.”</p>

<p>He paused to uplift and secure a tuft of golden rod
which had fallen across the path.</p>

<p>“I never did take so mich notice of her eyes,” he said
to himself. “They bain’t so crooked as that comes to—they
can see well enough, and that’s the p’int.”</p>

<p>He plucked out a tuft of groundsel which had hitherto
escaped his vigilant eye.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>“There’s nothin’ so much amiss wi’ her shape neither—I
d’ ’low I’d sooner have a nice little comfortable round-about
woman nor a great gawky faymale like a zowel or
a speaker. If she’s pluffy, she’s sprack, an’ that’s the
p’int.”</p>

<p>Whenever Daniel uttered this last phrase he seemed to
pluck up courage, and a momentary cheerfulness returned
to his face, which, nevertheless, speedily became overcast
again. Dall it all, he thought, why couldn’t folks keep
their tongues quiet. What was it to them what kind of
missus Daniel chose, that they must come tormenting
and ballyragging him? He didn’t meddle wi’ nobody,
and didn’t want nobody to meddle wi’ he, but there, even
the lord’s roughrider stopped him on the road to deliver,
as his opinion, that he, Daniel, had chosen a plain-headed
one. Old Mrs. Inkpen of the shop had laughed at him
for marrying a woman so many years older than himself.
Well, she’d be all the more sensible.</p>

<p>“Let ’em laugh if they do have a mind to; it’ll not
hurt Phœbe and I. We’ll soon show ’em who’s in the
right.”</p>

<p>And with that, he heaved a sigh and went indoors.</p>

<p>Next day he went to call for Phœbe, whom he had
promised to escort to afternoon church. She stood awaiting
him in her own doorway, which she filled up pretty
well it must be owned—a little ball of a woman with the
ugliest, merriest face it was possible to conceive. She
wore a very fine purple hat with a feather in the middle
and two red roses on each side, and this arrangement of
headgear seemed to accentuate the somewhat roving propensities<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
of her eyes. Pinned to her jacket was a bunch
of natural roses that vied with these in hue, and in one
stout hand she waved a posy, similar in colour and almost
equal in size, which was intended for her swain.</p>

<p>At sight of her bright face Daniel forgot all his troubles,
and after bestowing a sounding salute on her hard red
cheek, stood straight and stiff to be decorated, then, “Come
along, my dear,” said he, and they set forth arm-in-crook,
entirely satisfied with each other.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, as they walked through the churchyard,
Daniel was conscious of a dawning sense of discomfort,
for was not that Abel Bolt who stood under the yew tree,
and who stepped aside with such exaggerated deference
to let them pass? Even his hat seemed to Daniel to be
cocked with a sarcastic air. Martha Hansford and Freza
Pitcher nudged each other as Phœbe preceded him up
the church—he was almost sure he saw Martha spread out
her hands in allusion to Phœbe’s figure, which certainly
looked particularly ample in her thick cloth jacket. To
increase his uneasiness Jarge Vacher took up his position
immediately behind him. It must be owned that this
proximity was seriously detrimental to poor Daniel’s devotions.
When Phœbe found the place for him and
invited him to sing out of her own hymn-book he heard
a choking sound in his rear, which he knew proceeded
from Jarge. As he stole a cautious glance round he
observed that the eyes of more than one member of the
congregation were directed towards him and the unconscious
Phœbe, who happened to be in particularly fine voice
and was singing away with entire satisfaction. Daniel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
fidgeted and reddened and grew more and more wrathful.
He couldn’t see anything to laugh at, not he. The
maid was right to sing out, and to be a bit more tender
than usual to the man who, before twenty-four hours were
out, would be her husband. Yes, it would be all over by
this time to-morrow—that was one comfort; and it was a
mercy he had fixed an early hour; none of these impudent
chaps would be there to dather him.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of the service he started up and
hurried from the church with what seemed to Phœbe,
as she waddled in his wake, unseemly haste. Indeed
they very nearly had their first serious “miff” on the
subject. However, once out of sight of the mockers, and
wandering with his sweetheart in the quiet lanes, where
the hedgerows were all ablaze with scarlet berries, and
primrose and amber leaves made little points of light
here and there amid the more sober September green,
he forgot his discomfiture.</p>

<p>“We be like to have a hard winter,” said Phœbe, as
they paused to look over the first gate in the prescribed
fashion of rustic lovers.</p>

<p>“I don’t care,” returned Daniel, gazing at her amourously
from beneath his tilted hat. “I’ve got a snug little
place of my own and a missus to make me comfortable.
It may snow for all as I do care.”</p>

<p>Alas for Daniel! His jubilation was short-lived. Early
on the morrow he was up and doing, putting the final
touches to his preparations for welcoming his bride, and
he set forth in good time to join the wedding party, whom
he found ready and waiting for him, sitting stiffly in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
row in the parlour. Mr. Cosser, magnificent in broadcloth
and his father’s deerskin waistcoat; Mrs. Cosser in a violet
gown and a Paisley shawl; Dick Cosser, Phœbe’s younger
brother, in a suit of checks that would set an æsthetic
person’s teeth on edge; Phœbe herself in a crimson silk
with a white hat and a fluffy tippet, over which her eyes
twinkled with most uncanny effect. Daniel privately
thought she looked very well, and extended his arm to
his future mother-in-law, with a bosom swelling with
pride. Mr. Cosser had already preceded them with
Phœbe, and Dick brought up the rear with his cousin
Mary Ann, a tall maid of sixteen, who had an unusual
capacity for giggling; these two were to officiate respectively
as best man and bridesmaid. Daniel’s parents had
long been dead, and most of his relations scattered, but
his married sister who lived at some little distance, had
promised to drive over and meet them at the church.
She and her husband and their three or four olive-branches
were, in fact, already installed in one of the front pews
when the little procession arrived; the clergyman was in
readiness, and the ceremony began without delay.</p>

<p>All went well at first; Phœbe was jubilant and extremely
audible in her replies, Daniel gruff and sheepish
as it behoved a rustic bridegroom to be, but just as the
Rector uplifting his voice inquired “Dost thou take this
woman to be thy wedded wife?” a certain scuffling sound
was heard at the further end of the church, and the half-made
husband might have been seen to start and falter.
“Daniel, wilt thou have this woman to be thy wedded
wife?” repeated the Rector sternly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>Suppressed titters were heard, not only from the direction
of the porch, but actually from the aisles. For the
life of him, Daniel could not resist turning his head right
and left with an anguished gaze. Horror! There was
Abel Bolt peering from behind one pillar, and surely that
was Jarge’s impudent face grinning at him from the opposite
side. The Rector glared through his spectacles and
uplifted his voice yet more.</p>

<p>“Daniel!” he cried emphatically, “wilt thou have this
woman to be thy wedded wife?”</p>

<p>The best man cleared his throat warningly, and the
bride turning a reproachful glance somewhere in the direction
of the west window, nudged him with her elbow.</p>

<p>“Speak up!” she whispered. This was the last straw.</p>

<p>Hardly knowing what he did, Daniel started away from
her, and whisking round charged through the bridal party,
down the nave, thrust aside the knot of gaping onlookers
in the porch, descended the flight of steps apparently with
one stride, and bounding over the lychgate fled into the
fields on the opposite side of the road.</p>

<p>Phœbe, with a stifled shriek, hastened after him with
all the speed that her distress of mind and amplitude of
person would admit of, but was almost knocked over by
her brother Dick, who had started in hot pursuit of the
fugitive. Mary Ann, not to be outdone, gallopaded in the
rear, and Mr. Cosser with muttered threats of vengeance
hobbled in her wake at a considerable distance.</p>

<p>“Yoicks! Gone away!” shouted Abel Bolt, tumbling
out of the church followed by Jarge and the whole of the
idle crew who had brought about the catastrophe. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
another minute, the whole party joined in the chase, and
the church was left entirely deserted except for the astonished
and scandalised Rector, his clerk and poor old Mrs.
Cosser, who remained dissolved in tears in the front bench.
Even Daniel’s own relations had joined in pursuit, his
sister announcing breathlessly, as she hastened forth, that
he must have gone out of his mind.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the fugitive, in spite of the tightness of his
wedding boots and the stiffness of his new clothes, careered
across country, with almost incredible speed. Now his
blue-coated form might be seen leaping a hedge, now scudding
over a stretch of pasture. Dick, the best man, was
the nearest to him, family pride lending wings to his long
legs, but even he was soon distanced, and by the time he
had reached the second bank and forced his way through
the thorns and briars which topped it, the runaway bridegroom
was nowhere to be seen. Dick was at fault, and
though when the rest of the pursuers came up they scoured
the fields, and “drew” the thickets, and hunted up and
down by the banks, and even searched the willow-bed by
the river, no trace of the fugitive was to be found. Phœbe
had come to a standstill in the midst of the third field,
where her father presently joined her. They stood panting
opposite each other for a moment or two, after which
Phœbe, unfolding a lace-bordered handkerchief, wiped her
brow; then restoring it to her pocket, she remarked in a
tone of conviction:</p>

<p>“I d’ ’low he’ve a-changed his mind.”</p>

<p>“Looks like it,” returned her parent shortly. “Ye can
have the law on him for this.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>“That wouldn’t be much comfort to I,” she retorted.</p>

<p>“What be goin’ to do then?”</p>

<p>“I d’ ’low I’ll go home-along,” said the forsaken bride
with decision. “There bain’t no use in standin’ here for
the folks to gawk at, an’ I mid just so well take up one o’
they fowls. I shouldn’t think any o’ Dan’l’s folks ’ud want
to show their faces at our place.”</p>

<p>“I d’ ’low they won’t,” returned Mr. Cosser in a menacing
tone, as though who should say, “they’d better not!”</p>

<p>“Let’s be steppin’ then,” said Phœbe. “You’d best
look in at church and fetch mother. I’ll make haste
home.”</p>

<p>“That there Dan’l o’ yourn be a reg’lar rascal!” shouted
her father.</p>

<p>Phœbe, who had already proceeded some paces on her
way, turned her head and called back over her shoulder:
“I can’t say as how he’ve acted so very well!” Then
she went on again.</p>

<p>When the baffled hunting party finally gave up the
chase and returned to Cosser’s, partly with the hope of
being commended for their zeal, which they felt must have
atoned for all previous errors, partly to see how the forsaken
bride bore herself, they found that damsel in her
working dress, “salting down” a fine piece of beef.</p>

<p>“There’ll be a terr’ble lot o’ waste over this ’ere job,”
she remarked, “but we must do our best to save all what
we can.”</p>

<p>“We couldn’t find en nowheres, Phœbe,” cried Dick.
“Abel here d’ say he’s very like drownded; serve en right
if he be.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>Phœbe paused in her labours to cast a reflective glance
at the horizon.</p>

<p>“I’ll go warrant he bain’t drownded,” she said. “He
don’t want to marry I, that’s what ’tis. He wouldn’t ha’
married I a bit the more if you’d ha’ catched en.”</p>

<p>“But what’s the meanin’ of it,” thundered Mr. Cosser
from his corner, “what’s the meanin’ on’t, I want to
know. He did seem to know his own mind afore—very
well he did.”</p>

<p>“I think he was gallied like,” said Phœbe. “E-es, I d’
’low that’s what he wer’.”</p>

<p>Abel and Jarge began to edge away from the group,
but Phœbe went on without seeming to notice them.</p>

<p>“When Parson did ax en the question straight-out like,
I d’ ’low he felt ’fraid. That’s what ’twas, he was ’fraid.”</p>

<p>Withdrawing her gaze from the distant hills and heaving
a gentle sigh she carried away her beef; and as there
was no indication that any outsider was expected to join
the family circle, or indeed to partake of any refreshment,
the bystanders walked slowly away, and the Cosser family
proceeded gloomily to divest themselves of their holiday
clothes.</p>

<p>It was quite dark when Daniel rose from his cramped
and exceedingly moist hiding-place in the sedges by the
river, and slowly betook himself homewards. During the
many hours he had lain cowering there, listening to the
voices of his pursuers, he had had leisure to repent of and
marvel at the senseless impulse which had brought him to
his present plight.</p>

<p>“Well, I be a stunpoll!” he had said to himself over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
and over again. “I be a dalled stunpoll! What the
mischief did I do it for? Whatever will the poor maid
think of I? She’ll never look at I again—she’ll never take
the leastest notice of me.”</p>

<p>More than once he had been half-inclined to rush out of
his lair and give himself up to justice, but how could he
face that grinning multitude? If they had made fun of
him before, what would they do now? Besides her family
were furious, and the rustic mind loves justice of a certain
rough kind. Daniel was not more of a coward than another,
but he had a wholesome dread of broken bones.
No, he dursn’t show his face for a long time, that was
certain; and as for ever making up with Phœbe again, it
was out of the question—no woman could forgive such
treatment.</p>

<p>Very disconsolately, indeed, did Daniel turn in at his
own little gate; even in the dusk he could see how nice
the place looked, how complete were his arrangements.
He opened the door and slunk in, dropping into the
nearest chair with a groan. After quite a long time he
made up his mind to strike a match and look round,
though he knew the sight of the cosy little room would
increase his melancholy. He lit the blue glass lamp which
had been placed in readiness on the dresser, and with a
heavy sigh poked up the fire which had been carefully
“kept in” with a thick layer of wet slack. The light
leaped on the newly-papered walls with their neat design
of blue roses on a buff ground—he had papered these
walls himself, in honour of the coming event—on the two
elbow-chairs, just re-covered with a gay chintz. On the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
table in the centre was a small tray with a biblical design
in prodigiously bright colours, which bore a curious old
decanter containing elderberry wine, a plate of mixed
biscuits and two tumblers. In setting these forth that
morning he had thought with tender glee of how Phœbe’s
first wifely task would be to “hot-up” some of that wine
in one of her new saucepans. Had it not been for his own
inconceivable folly, they might at that very moment have
been sitting face to face drinking each other’s health.
And now! Daniel dropped his face in his hands and
fairly sobbed.</p>

<p>One day about a fortnight after the untoward event
which had so rudely quenched her simple hopes, Phœbe
Cosser was standing by the wash-tub up to her eyes in
suds, with Mary Ann similarly engaged; while Mrs.
Cosser in the inner room laboriously ironed out a few of
the fine things which had already passed through her
daughter’s hands. All at once, Mary Ann, raising her
eyes, uttered a little scream which immediately lost itself
in a fit of giggles.</p>

<p>“There! I never did see such a foolish maid!” commented
Phœbe severely. “Whatever be gawkin’ at?”</p>

<p>“Lard! There now! Well, to be sure!” ejaculated
Mary Ann between spasmodic titters. “Look yonder
behind the thorn tree!”</p>

<p>The Cossers’ garden sloped downwards towards the
road, and a gnarled May tree filled the angle where the
front hedge joined that which separated their piece of
ground from their neighbour’s; the twisted trunk was
split down to a few feet from the ground, and through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
this aperture Daniel Chaffey’s woeful face was peering.
As Phœbe turned towards him he immediately dived out
of sight. After waiting a moment and finding he did not
reappear Phœbe philosophically went on with her washing.
In a few minutes, however, Mary Ann began to giggle
afresh. Phœbe whisked round so sharply that she caught
a glimpse of her former lover’s vanishing face.</p>

<p>“Don’t take no notice,” she said sternly, implanting a
vicious nudge in her cousin’s ribs; after which she shifted
her position so as to turn her back to the thorn.</p>

<p>After another short interval, however, the sound of her
own name breathed in the most dolorous of tones caused
her to turn her head once more. Daniel had thrown an
arm round each half of the trunk, and was craning forth
through the gap, his face vying in colour with the clusters
of haws which surrounded it.</p>

<p>“Phœbe!” he pleaded with a gusty sigh.</p>

<p>“Well?” returned she, slowly wiping the suds from her
stout red arms.</p>

<p>“Phœbe, I’ve acted terr’ble bad to ye.”</p>

<p>“E-es, you have,” replied Phœbe succinctly.</p>

<p>“I d’ ’low I have,” he agreed dejectedly. “I be pure
sorry, dalled if I bain’t.”</p>

<p>Miss Cosser snorted.</p>

<p>“I’ve a-repented, my dear, ever since. E-es, I have!
Sure I have! Phœbe!”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“I’ve a-been thinkin’—would ye go to church wi’ me
now?”</p>

<p>“This minute?” queried Phœbe with alacrity; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
muscles of her face relaxed, and she twitched down first
one of her rolled-up sleeves and then the other.</p>

<p>“E-es, this very minute; the Reverend ’ull tie us up
right enough if I ax en.”</p>

<p>“Gie me a clean apron!” cried Phœbe, turning quickly
to Mary Ann and jerking at the string of the very damp
garment which protected her dress.</p>

<p>She already wore her hat, and by the time her cousin,
who had vanished with a bound, reappeared shaking out
the crisp folds of the clean white apron, she had unpinned
her skirt.</p>

<p>“Now, then,” she remarked after tying it on, and she
fixed her best eye with a business-like air on her Daniel,
who had been gazing at her with almost incredulous rapture.
He left off embracing the hawthorn and reached
the garden gate at the same moment as Phœbe herself;
and before Mrs. Cosser, attracted by Mary Ann’s shrieks
of enjoyment, had had time to reach the door they had
set off arm-in-crook and disappeared round the angle of
the lane.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">“A TERR’BLE VOOLISH LITTLE MAID.”</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> cottage next door to Mrs. Cross had long been occupied
by Mr. and Mrs. Frizzel, but when that good couple
went to live “Darchester-side” near their married daughter
Susan, their discarded dwelling was taken by a respectable
widow woman named Chaffey; and on a certain autumn
morning she entered into possession.</p>

<p>From under the green “shed” of his cart the carrier
extracted a variety of goods and chattels, exciting keen
interest in the mind of Mrs. Cross, who, with her nose
flattened against the leaded panes of her bedroom window,
watched the proceedings closely. The large articles of
furniture had arrived on the previous day in a waggon—a
wooden bedstead, so solid in construction and uncompromising
in shape that its legs had hung over the edge; an
oak settle and carved linen chest at which Mrs. Cross had
turned up her nose, deeming them “terr’ble old-fayshioned”.</p>

<p>She was better pleased with the parlour suite of painted
wood cushioned with brightly coloured cretonne—couch,
armchair and three small chairs; the lot must have cost
at least three pound ten, thought Mrs. Cross, for she had
seen the like in the upholsterer’s window at Branston.
Her respect for the newcomer immediately increased, and
this morning as she squinted down at her from her attic,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
vainly endeavouring to see all round her at once, she was
much impressed by her appearance.</p>

<p>Mrs. Chaffey was a spare woman of middle height,
wearing a decent brown stuff gown and grey fringed shawl.
Her black bonnet with its yellow flowers was quite “fayshionable”
in shape, and though her black kid gloves were
unbuttoned and had moreover grown somewhat grey about
the finger-tips, they nevertheless conveyed the idea of
exceeding respectability.</p>

<p>“Quite a genteel sort o’ body,” commented Mrs. Cross,
“and do seem to know what she be about too,” she added
a moment later, as Mrs. Chaffey, having entered the house
presently emerged again, having changed her headgear
for a gathered print sun-bonnet, and protected her dress
by the addition of a large white apron.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cross screwed her head in the other angle of the
window and again squinted down.</p>

<p>“That’s a feather bed,” she observed as a large tied-up
bundle was placed in the expectant arms of the newcomer
who clearly staggered beneath its weight; “carrier did
ought to carry it for she. Pillows next! And a basket—chaney
most like. Fender—fire-irons—kettle—pots and
a pan or two—very small ’uns they be. ’Tis but a lone
’ooman they d’ say, she’ll not want so much cookin’—clock—hassock——”</p>

<p>The carrier’s voice now interrupted the inventory:
“This ’ere basket, mum—that do make the lot. I hope
ye’ll find all reg’lar, mum, and no damage done.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Cross, who had been breathing hard in her excitement,
was at this point constrained to polish the window<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
with her apron; by the time the operation was concluded
and her nose again applied, Mrs. Chaffey had taken out
her purse and was slowly counting out a certain number
of coins into the carrier’s hand. Mrs. Cross could not for
the life of her see how many, but she observed that the
man’s face lengthened.</p>

<p>“Bain’t there nothin’ for luck?” he inquired. “I did
take a deal o’ trouble wi’ they arnaments and sich-like.”</p>

<p>“You’ve a-had what I did agree for,” responded Mrs.
Chaffey with dignity; her voice was high and clear, and
as she spoke she turned towards the cottage with a final
air.</p>

<p>“I d’ ’low she’s a bit near,” remarked Mrs. Cross as
she retired from the window, rubbing her nose pensively.
“Poor Martha Frizzel! She was a good soul, she <i>was</i>!
Just about!”</p>

<p>She stood a moment looking round the little attic chamber,
but without seeing either the somewhat untidy bed
with its soiled patchwork quilt, or the washstand with its
cracked jug, or the torn curtain pinned half-across the
window; she saw instead her neighbour’s shrewd, kindly
face bending over a pot of well-stewed tea, or nodding
briefly in response to sundry requests for the use of a
bucket, or the loan of a pan, and sometimes a few “spuds”.</p>

<p>“Mind you do bring ’em back,” was all Mrs. Frizzel
would say. Well, sometimes Mrs. Cross did bring them
back, and sometimes Martha came and fetched ’em, but
she never made a bit of fuss, and was always as kind and
neighbourly as she could be.</p>

<p>Mrs. Chaffey must be getting a bit settled by this time,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
Mrs. Cross thought, and resolved to pop in and ask how
she was getting on. She smoothed her rough hair with
the palms of her hands, jerked down her sleeves, which she
usually wore rolled up till dinner-time, not because she
fatigued herself with over-much work, but because it
seemed somehow the proper thing to do of a morning;
she twitched her apron straight, pinned over a gap in
her bodice—Mrs. Cross was a great believer in the efficacy
of pins, and rarely demeaned herself by using a needle
and thread—and finally composing her features to an
expression of polite and sympathetic interest, strolled
leisurely downstairs and into her neighbour’s premises.</p>

<p>Mrs. Chaffey was standing by her table, busily unpacking
china, but when the other entered remarking genially
that she thought she’d just look in to see how Mrs.
Chaffey liked her noo place, and if she could lend a
hand anywheres, she came forward with a somewhat
frosty smile and set a chair.</p>

<p>“Sit down, won’t ye?” she said. “I’m a bit busy, but
there! it do do folks good to set a bit now and then.”</p>

<p>“E-es, indeed, my dear,” responded Mrs. Cross enthusiastically;
it was a sentiment she cordially endorsed.
“Lard! if a body was to keep upon their legs from morn
till night, churchyard ’ud be fuller at the year’s end nor
it needs to be. I be pure glad you’ve a-took this ’ere
house,” she added graciously, “’tis what I scarce expected
as any respectable party ’ud come to it. The chimbley
smokes,” said Mrs. Cross delightedly; “there, ’tis summat
awful how it do smoke! And in the bedroom the rain
and wind do fair beat in when a bit of a storm do come—’tis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
these ’ere queer little vooty winder-panes—rain
comes through them so easy as anything. And the
damp! there, Mrs. Frizzel, what lived here last, used
to say many a time: ‘Mrs. Cross, my dear,’ she did
use to say, ‘the damp do seem to creep into my very
bwones’. But I be pure glad to see you here, I’m
sure,” she summed up cheerfully, “and ’tis to be hoped
as you’ll find it comfortable.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Chaffey’s face, always somewhat plaintive in expression,
had become more and more dismal as her
neighbour proceeded, and she now heaved a deep sigh.</p>

<p>“I d’ ’low ’twill do for I,” she said gloomily; “I be
a lone ’ooman, Mrs. ——?”</p>

<p>She paused tentatively.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Cross be my name, my dear. E-es—Maria
Cross. E-es, that be my name, my dear.”</p>

<p>“Well, Mrs. Cross,” resumed the newcomer, taking
up her discourse in a voice tuned to just the same note
of melancholy patience as before, “well, Mrs. Cross, as I
was a-sayin’, I be a lone ’ooman, a widow ’ooman, and
I d’ ’low I must look to be put upon. I bain’t surprised
to hear o’ the house bein’ damp and the chimbley smokin’—’tis
jest what I mid have expected; and so I’ll tell the
agent when I do go for to pay my rent.”</p>

<p>“It did ought to be considered in the rent,” suggested
Mrs. Cross.</p>

<p>“It did,” agreed Mrs. Chaffey, and for a moment her
eyes assumed an uncommonly wide-awake expression.
“I’ll mention it to the gentleman, but I don’t look for
much satisfaction—I don’t indeed, Mrs. Cross. A few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
shillin’s back maybe, and a new chimbley-pot, and toils
put right on the roof, and a bit o’ lead paper maybe at
back o’ my bed—no more nor that, Mrs. Cross—they’ll
not do more than that for a lone ’ooman.”</p>

<p>“And didn’t ye never ha’ no childern?” inquired Mrs.
Cross, with her head on one side; “it do seem molloncholy
for ye to be left wi’out nobody to do a hand’s turn
for ’ee, poor soul.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Chaffey shook her head with a portentous expression.</p>

<p>“A-h-h-h, Mrs. Cross, my dear,” she said, “if there was
sich a thing as a bit o’ gratitood in this world, I wouldn’t
be left wi’out a creature to do for me at my time o’ life.
Childern of my own I have not,” said Mrs. Chaffey, with
an air which indicated that the fact was very much to her
credit, “but there’s them livin’ now as I’ve been more
than a mother to, what have gone and left I in my ancient
years—as thankless.”</p>

<p>“Lard, now!” ejaculated her neighbour, much interested;
“ye don’t tell I so, Mrs. Chaffey. Somebody what you’ve
a-been very good to, I suppose, mum?”</p>

<p>“Good!” echoed Mrs. Chaffey. “Good’s not the word
for it, Mrs. Cross. ’Twas my first cousin’s child—a poor
little penniless maid what was brought up in a institootion—an
orphan, my dear, as hadn’t nobody in the world
to look to. Well, when her time was up at the institootion,
I come for’ard, and I says, ‘I’ll take her,’ I
says; ‘she don’t need to go to service,’ I says. ‘I’m
her mother’s cousin,’ I told ’em, ‘and she can come to
live wi’ I.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>“And they were delighted of course,” suggested Mrs.
Cross, as she paused impressively.</p>

<p>“No; if you’ll believe me, they fair dathered I wi’ axin’
questions, and wantin’ I to make promises and that.
‘Why didn’t I come and see the maid afore?’ says they,
as if ’twas likely, Mrs. Cross, as I’d go trapesin’ off to a
institootion to ax arter a maid as was too small to be any
good to anybody. Then they did want I to give her
wages. Wages to a little bit of a thing as knowed nothin’,
and couldn’t do nothin’! ‘No,’ I says, ‘I’ll give her a
home,’ I says, ‘and I’ll be a mother to her, and train her
same as if she was my own child, but more than that I
will <i>not</i> do.’”</p>

<p>“O’ course not,” agreed Mrs. Cross; “lucky enough
she was to get sich a good offer, <i>I</i> think.”</p>

<p>“And so you may,” agreed the other solemnly, “and
so I did often say to the maid herself. ‘You may think
yourself lucky,’ I did say to her often and often; ‘many
another,’ I did tell her, ‘’ud put you out on the road when
you do behave so voolish. But me! look at the patience
I’ve had wi’ you!’ ’Twas a terr’ble voolish maid, Mrs.
Cross—she was a bit silly in herself to begin with, and
they institootions—Lard, they do never seem to teach
a maid a thing as ’ull be a bit o’ use to ’em! She could
scrub a stone passage a mile long if she was put to it,
but there bain’t no passages in cottages, and she couldn’t
so much as peel a potato or wash a cabbage. Well, I did
take so much pains wi’ her as a mother could ha’ done—I
did make her find out for herself how to hold a knife,
no matter how much she did cut herself. ‘Find out,’ I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
did say; and she <i>did</i> find out. And when grubs come
up on the dish wi’ the cabbages, I’d cut off the bits as
was nearest to ’em and put ’em on her plate; so she did
soon learn, ye see. Sleep! that maid ’ud sleep many an’
many a cold morning arter I’d pulled blankets off her—e-es,
there she’d lay so fast as anything, and never take
a bit o’ notice till I got a drap o’ cold water—an that
didn’t always wake her up all to once. There, she was
fair aggravatin’!—when I did get her up at last and get
back to bed again, I couldn’t get a wink o’ sleep for thinkin’
on’t.”</p>

<p>“Dear, to be sure! Well now!” commented Mrs. Cross,
scratching her elbows appreciatively.</p>

<p>“E-es, indeed,” continued Mrs. Chaffey, warming with
her theme. “I did tell her many a time, ‘You’ll come to
no good’. Ah, that I did, and she didn’t come to no good
neither.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t she though?” queried the other with interest.
“Took up with a soldier, very like?”</p>

<p>“Nothin’ o’ the kind. There weren’t no soldiers anywheres
near us. ’Twas another kind of a man altogether.”</p>

<p>“A-h-h,” groaned Mrs. Cross sympathetically. “And
I s’pose he wouldn’t marry her, mum?”</p>

<p>“E-es, he married her, Mrs. Cross,” responded the widow
in a tone of dignified surprise. “E-es, he married her.
Indeed he did.”</p>

<p>“But there was carryin’s on, I s’pose?” suggested
Mrs. Cross respectfully.</p>

<p>Mrs. Chaffey fixed her with a stony stare.</p>

<p>“I’m not one as ’ud allow no carryin’s on,” she returned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
loftily. “When the man come and axed Jenny—that was
her name—I says to her, ‘Not with my consent,’ I says—well,
she took and got married wi’out it.”</p>

<p>“Lard ha’ mercy me,” ejaculated the listener, seeing that
she was expected to say something, “well, that was——”
she hesitated, “I s’pose the man wasn’t one as you’d
ha’ picked for her, Mrs. Chaffey? Maybe,” she added
darkly, “he wasn’t in work?”</p>

<p>“He was in work,” replied Mrs. Chaffey solemnly,
“reg’lar. Oh, e-es, he was in <i>work</i>.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Cross was a good deal mystified, and being too
uncertain of her ground to venture on a comment,
contented herself with clicking her tongue and turning
up her eyes.</p>

<p>“’Tis a queer tale; ’tis indeed,” resumed the widow;
“but as I did often say to she arter the job was done:
‘Don’t blame me, Jenny—what you did do, you did do wi’
your eyes open. I’ve a-told you plain,’ I says, ‘I’ve gied
ye the best advice. Stay,’ I says, ‘where you’re well off.
You’ve a-got a good home,’ I did tell her, ‘and one what
is a mother to ye—don’t ye go for to take up with this
’ere stranger.’”</p>

<p>“Ah,” interrupted Mrs. Cross, beginning to think she
at last saw daylight, “he was a stranger, was he?”</p>

<p>“He was a man what come to the door,” returned the
other impressively, “what come to the door like any tramp.
I did take en to be a tramp first off.”</p>

<p>“Oh, and he wasn’t a tramp then?” put in her neighbour,
slightly disappointed.</p>

<p>“He <i>mid</i> ha’ been one,” resumed the narrator, with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
dignified wave of the hand intended to discourage further
unnecessary and frivolous questions. “I’m willing to tell
’ee about it, Mrs. Cross, if you be willing to listen. ’Twas
a Sunday of all days. We’d a’ been pretty busy till dinner-time.
I’d got Jenny up soon arter four to get through wi’
cleanin’ up—I’m always one what likes to have the place
reg’lar perfect, ye know—and by the time I come down
for breakfast she’d a’ got everything straight. Well, her
an’ me fell out—she did want if ye please to go to church
wi’ I—so I says to her, ‘Who’s to get dinner then? Be I
to wait on you?’ says I. ‘No,’ I says, ‘you stay at home
and do your dooty, and you can go to the childern’s service
in the afternoon if you behave well,’ says I. Well, but
she wouldn’t hear reason; I did leave her cryin’ like a baby.</p>

<p>“I were a bit late comin’ back—chattin’ to this one and
that one, an’ when I got in, what did I see but a strange
man by the fire. Ye could ha’ knocked I down wi’ a
feather. I did jist drap in the first chair I come to and
p’int that way wi’ my finger—I couldn’t get out a word.</p>

<p>“‘Please ye, ma’am,’ says Jenny (I wouldn’t have her
callin’ I <i>Cousin Maria</i>, d’ye see, a little maid same as her
out of a institootion! She did offer to call I so once or
twice, but I soon checked her). ‘Please ye, ma’am,’ she
says, ‘this ’ere poor chap was so terr’ble cold—froze up he
was—he’d a-been walkin’ ten mile an’ more in the snow;
and when he axed I to let en in to warm hisself a bit, I
didn’t think you’d object.’</p>

<p>“‘You didn’t think I’d object,’ says I. ‘You little
good-for-nothin’ hussy! We might ha’ been robbed an’
murdered for all you care.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>“The man turned round laughin’ as impident as ye like.
He was a Irishman, Mrs. Cross—I could tell it the very
minute I clapped eyes on his face, afore he so much as
opened his mouth, and when he did begin to speak, Lard
ha’ mercy me! I never did hear sick languidge.”</p>

<p>“Swearin’ an’ that?” questioned Mrs. Cross, with her
head on one side.</p>

<p>“Oh no, nothin’ o’ that sort, but sick a queer, ignorant
fayshion o’ talkin’. ‘The top o’ the mornin’ to ye, ma’am,’
says he. ‘Is it murther ye’re talkin’ of? Sure, how could
I be afther murtherin’ ye when ye weren’t here?’ he says.
‘Don’t ye be afeerd,’ he went on—I can’t really remember
his queer talk, but he said he had come over harvestin’ an’
then got laid up wi’ a fever, an’ was a long time in hospital,
and now, he said, he was on his way to see a friend who
had been in the hospital at the same time, and after that
he had the promise of work.</p>

<p>“A reg’lar cock-and-bull story; I didn’t believe a word
on’t. I did tell en so.</p>

<p>“‘Why be ye a-trapsin’ the roads then,’ says I, ‘if you’ve
a-been invited to stay with a friend?’</p>

<p>“‘I missed my road,’ says he, ‘I took the wrong turn;
I shan’t get there till night now,’ he says. ‘I’m a bit
weak still with being sick so long, and it’ll take me all
my time to get there.’</p>

<p>“‘You’d best be startin’ then,’ says I, p’intin’ to the
door. Then if ye’ll believe it that little impident maid
ups and interferes.</p>

<p>“‘Oh, ma’am,’ she says, ‘let him bide and eat a bit o’
dinner wi’ us. I’m sure he’s a respectable man, and it’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
Sunday and all. And there’s more dinner nor we can
eat.’</p>

<p>“Well, I could ha’ shook her—‘I’ll thank ye, Jenny,
to mind your own business,’ I says, ‘a little chit like you,
what’s kept for charity. Bain’t it enough,’ I says, ‘to be
beholden to I for every bit you do put into your own
mouth wi’out wantin’ to waste the food what don’t belong
to ye on good-for-nothin’ tramps and idlers?’ I says.
Then the man gets up.</p>

<p>“‘That’ll do, ma’am,’ he says, ‘I wouldn’t touch bite or
sup of yours,’ he says, ‘for fear it ’ud stick in my throat.
Good-bye my dear,’ he says to Jenny, ‘an’ blessin’s on
your pretty face and your kind heart. Maybe better
times ’ull be comin’ for you as well as for me,’ he says.”</p>

<p>“Ah,” put in Mrs. Cross excitedly, “he had summat in
his mind about her, you mid be sure.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Chaffey threw out a warning hand once more and
pursued her narrative.</p>

<p>“I did give the maid a right-down good talkin’-to, you
mid think, but it didn’t seem to do her much good.</p>

<p>“About a week or two arter, I was sendin’ her to fetch
the washin’ back—I did use to wash for a lady what lived
a mile away, and sometimes carrier did fetch it, and sometimes
I did send Jenny. Well, ’twas a heavyish basket, and
when I did see her marchin’ back down the path, I says to
her:—</p>

<p>“‘You’ve a-been quicker nor I could ha’ looked for,’ I
says.</p>

<p>“‘Oh, e-es,’ says she, ‘somebody helped I for to carry
it.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>“‘Somebody,’ I says. ‘Who?’</p>

<p>“She went quite red, and opened her mouth and shut it
again, and then she says very quick:—</p>

<p>“‘Oh, a man what I met, as said it did seem too heavy
for I.’”</p>

<p>“Ah-h-h!” said Mrs. Cross, seizing her opportunity as
the other paused for breath, “it was him?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Chaffey resented the other’s eagerness to jump to
a conclusion, and continued in a voice of increased sternness,
and without noticing the interruption:—</p>

<p>“Next day was a Sunday again. I wasn’t feelin’ so
very well, so I did tell her she mid go to church that
mornin’ an’ I’d bide at home. Well, that there little maid
took so long a-dressin’ of herself as if she was a queen; so
arter I’d called her once or twice I just went upstairs an’
looked in at her. I had my soft shoes on, and she didn’t
hear I comin’.</p>

<p>“There she was, if you please, a-kneeling before her bed,
a-turnin’ of her head this way an’ that, an’ a-lookin’ at herself
in a wold lid of a biscuit-box, what she’d picked up
somewheres an’ rubbed up till it did seem so bright as
silver. There! the little impident hussy; she had stood
it up against her pillow, an’ she was a-lookin’ at herself an’
a-holdin’ up a bit o’ blue ribbon, fust under her chin an’
then sideways again her hat.</p>

<p>“‘Jenny,’ I says, an’, dear, to be sure, how the voolish
maid did jump!</p>

<p>“‘Lard, ma’am,’ says she, ‘you did fray me!’</p>

<p>“‘What be doin’ there?’ I axes her very sharp. ‘What
be doin’ with that there ribbon? Where did you get<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
it?’ I says, for I knowed very well she hadn’t a penny of
her own.</p>

<p>“She went so red as a poppy, an’ stood still, gawkin’ at
I, wi’out making no answer.</p>

<p>“‘You did steal it, I d’ ’low,’ I says, an’ I gives a kind
of a scream.</p>

<p>“Then she did go white, and her teeth fair chattered in
her head.</p>

<p>“‘Oh, no, ma’am,’ she cried; ‘no, indeed. It be mine,
honest. It was give me.’</p>

<p>“‘Give ye,’ says I. ‘Who give it?’</p>

<p>“Then she did begin a-cryin’ and a-rockin’ of herself
backwards an’ forrads. ‘It be mine,’ she sobs; ‘somebody
did give it to I.’</p>

<p>“‘<i>Somebody!</i>’ I says, an’ the notion come to I all to
once. ‘It was never that man as you met on the road
yesterday?’</p>

<p>“Not a word would she answer, but goes on cryin’.</p>

<p>“‘Jenny Medway,’ I says to her, ‘I’ll come to the
bottom of this here tale if I do have to call Policeman
Jackson in for to take ’ee to prison. Tell I the truth this
minute, or I’ll run out an’ fetch en. It won’t be the first
time as you’ve met that man, whoever he be. Own up, or
I’ll call Jackson.’</p>

<p>“Well, she was real scared, an’ she ketched hold o’ my
arm:—</p>

<p>“‘Oh don’t, ma’am, don’t do that!’ she says, ‘I’ll tell ’ee—I’ll
tell ’ee. ’Twas the man what did come to the door——’</p>

<p>“‘You wicked, wicked wench!’ I says. ‘I d’ ’low ye’ve
a-been meetin’ of en regular.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>“‘No, indeed, ma’am,’ she cries, ‘I never set eyes on
en since that day, till yesterday, when I did meet en quite
accidental-like—an’ he did offer to carry my basket for I,
an’ he did put his hand in’s pocket an’ pull out this bit o’
ribbon—he’d a-been carryin’ it about hopin’ to meet I, he
did say, for he did think it jist the same colour as my
eyes.’”</p>

<p>“Well! well! well!” exclaimed Mrs. Cross, clapping
her hands together and shaking her head. “Lard
now! dear to be sure! What nonsense-talk, weren’t it,
ma’am?”</p>

<p>“I did tell her so indeed,” returned Mrs. Chaffey, severely.
“I did tell her plain what I thought of her—‘Courtin’ an’
carryin’ on wi’ a tramp on the road!’ I says.</p>

<p>“‘He bain’t a tramp,’ she cries, quite in a temper, if you
please. ‘He’s an honest, respectable young man. He’ve
a-got good work now, an’ he be a-lookin’ for to settle.’”</p>

<p>“Ah!” put in the irrepressible Mrs. Cross. “He was
lookin’ out for a wife.”</p>

<p>Once more Mrs. Chaffey quelled her with a glance and
proceeded:—</p>

<p>“‘An’ be he wantin’ you to settle wi’ en?’ I axed the
maid straight-out.</p>

<p>“She hangs her head, an’ begins a-playin’ wi’ the buttons
of her bodice.</p>

<p>“‘He did say so,’ she says, very low; ‘he did ax I to
walk wi’ en an’ think it over—he be gettin’ good wage,’ she
says, lookin’ up at me. ‘He says he’ll do all what he can
for me—I think I could like en very well—I d’ ’low he be
a good man.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>Mrs. Cross clicked her tongue and shook her head with
an air of disapproval.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed, my dear,” cried Mrs. Chaffey warmly,
“that was my own opinion. My dooty did stare I in the
face.”</p>

<p>“‘Put that there notion out of your head, Jenny,’ I says
to her, very firm, ‘for I’ll never hear on’t—never!’ I says.
‘If you was a-thinkin’ o’ meetin’ that idle good-for-nothin’
fellow this mornin’, you may give up the notion. Take off
your hat,’ I says, ‘an’ put by that jacket of yours. Outside
this house you don’t set foot this day. You bide at home,’
I says.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Cross looked dubious at first, but catching the
other’s severe eye, shook her head once more in an impersonal
way, and folded her arms with an appearance of
great unconcern.</p>

<p>“The way that maid did go on,” pursued Mrs. Chaffey,
“was scandalous, quite scandalous, I do assure ’ee. She
cried an’ sobbed, and acskally tried for to dodge round to
the door, but I were too quick for her. I nipped out first,
and turned the key in the lock.</p>

<p>“Well, if you’ll believe me, jist about dinner-time, who
should come walkin’ up to the house as bold as brass, but
my gentleman himself, an’ before I could shut door in’s
face if that little bold hussy didn’t call out to en from the
window: ‘I’m locked in, Mr. Connor, I’m locked in!’</p>

<p>“‘Locked in, are ye?’ says he; an’ for the minute I
was frightened at the looks of en.</p>

<p>“If ye’ll believe me, Mrs. Cross, the fellow walks straight
into the house, makin’ no more o’ me nor if I wasn’t there.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>
He pushes past I, and marches upstairs and bursts open
the door o’ Jenny’s room.</p>

<p>“‘Locked in, are ye?’ he says. ‘I’ll soon settle that.
Come down, asthore’—E-es, ’twas some such name as that
he did call her—‘come down, asthore. I’ve a little word
to say to ye, an’ I want this good lady to hear it as well
as yerself.’</p>

<p>“‘I’ll call the police,’ I says. ‘I’ll call them in a minute,’
I says.”</p>

<p>“I’d a-done that, I’m sure,” cried Mrs. Cross. “I’m
sure I would. Housebreakin’ ye know. <i>Did</i> ye call ’em?”
she added, as Mrs. Chaffey seemed to hesitate.</p>

<p>“Well, no, my dear,” returned that lady. “I did not.
I was all shaky an’ trembley like. Besides,” she added,
casting up her eyes, “I be always for peace, Mrs. Cross.
‘Peace an’ quietness,’ is my motto. I could no more break
the law o’ Christian lovin’ kindness nor—nor anything,
Mrs. Cross.”</p>

<p>“‘Now, Jenny, alanna,’” says the man, ‘you an’ me
was talkin’ yesterday, so I may as well come to the p’int
at once. I want a home, an’ you want a home.’</p>

<p>“‘You make a mistake,’ says I, ‘the girl does <i>not</i> want
a home. Jenny has got a good home—a better home nor
she do deserve,’ I says.</p>

<p>“‘A pretty home!’ says he; ‘a prison! Don’t mind
her, me darlin’. Just look me in the face, an’ tell me will
ye have me?’</p>

<p>“‘I will,’ she says, so bold as brass—the little barefaced,
impident wench! I did really blush for her.</p>

<p>“‘Then,’ says he, ‘I’ll put up the banns on Sunday, an’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>
the two of us ’ull be j’ined together before the month’s
out.’</p>

<p>“Well! To think of the chap settlin’ everythin’ straight
off, an’ she givin’ in wi’out so much as a question! I stood
gawkin’ at ’em both, wi’ my tongue quite speechless.
Then the chap goes up to Jenny, and says he:—</p>

<p>“‘I’m sorry we can’t walk out by ourselves,’ he says,
‘but we must do wi’out that.’ An’ before my very eyes,
Mrs. Cross, he puts his arm round her waist, an’ kisses
her. ‘I’ll strive to be a good husband to ye,’ says
he, ‘an’ I’ll engage I’ll have the best little wife in the
world.’</p>

<p>“Then he turns round to I an’ whips off his hat, jist out
o’ pure impidence.</p>

<p>“‘Good mornin’ to ye, ma’am,’ he says; ‘I’m afraid its
losin’ yer black slave ye’ll be.’”</p>

<p>“<i>Oh!</i>” interrupted Mrs. Cross, much scandalised.
“Such a thing to say.”</p>

<p>“E-es, indeed,” responded Mrs. Chaffey, “an’ me as
had a-been so good to her. I did tell her so, so soon as
I’d got my breath. ‘Me, what has been a mother to ye,’
I did tell her, ‘that ye should go a-backbitin’ o’ I an’
a-sayin’ such things.’</p>

<p>“‘I never said nothin’, ma’am,’ says she.</p>

<p>“Such a story. It do stand to reason as if she must ha’
gone abusin’ o’ I.”</p>

<p>“Maybe he thought of hissel’ you was a bit hard on
her,” said Mrs. Cross, struck by a brilliant idea.</p>

<p>The inspiration, however, was not a happy one apparently.
Mrs. Chaffey took great umbrage, and it was,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>
indeed, some time before her neighbour could pacify her
sufficiently to induce her to continue her tale.</p>

<p>“I did talk to her kind, an’ I did talk to her sharp,” she
resumed, in an aggrieved tone. “But no; she wouldn’t
hear reason, an’ at last I did fair lose patience.</p>

<p>“‘Well, then,’ says I, ‘I be done wi’ ’ee; I’ll ha’ no
more to say to ’ee from this out. If you do leave yer good
home,’ I says, ‘an’ desert one what’s the same as yer
mother, I be done wi’ ’ee. Mark my words,’ I did tell
her, ‘this ’ere marriage’ll turn out unlucky. You’ll repent
it all the days of your life.’”</p>

<p>“Ah!” said Mrs. Cross, sucking in her breath with
gruesome relish. “An’ she did, Mrs. Chaffey, I should
think. She <i>did</i>.”</p>

<p>“She did ought to,” returned Mrs. Chaffey, impressively,
and paused.</p>

<p>“I d’ ’low she hasn’t done so very well for herself?”
insinuated the other. “She hasn’t a-got such a very good
home.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Chaffey rubbed her nose and coughed, but apparently
did not feel called upon to enter into particulars as
to the recreant Jenny’s domicile.</p>

<p>“Her man be out o’ work pretty often, I dare say?”
hinted Mrs. Cross.</p>

<p>“Not as I’ve heerd on, so far,” returned her neighbour, in
a tone which implied that Mr. Connor would probably find
himself thrown upon the world in a very short time.</p>

<p>“Any family, my dear?”</p>

<p>“Two,” replied the widow. “Two childern, Mrs. Cross—a
boy an’ a girl.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>“You haven’t ever seen them, of course?”</p>

<p>“E-es, my dear,” responded Mrs. Chaffey, with a superior
air. “I do see ’em two or three times a year. I bain’t
one for to bear malice. When her ’usband do drive her
over on a Bank Holiday I could never have the ’eart for
to shut my door i’ their faces.”</p>

<p>“Drive over!” exclaimed Mrs. Cross. “They must be
free wi’ their dibs to go throwin’ ’em about on car-hire.”</p>

<p>“It don’t cost them nothin’,” said Mrs. Chaffey hastily.
“’Tis their own trap.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Cross gasped.</p>

<p>“They keeps a trap! They must be pretty well off.”</p>

<p>Seeing that this remark was evidently unpleasing to her
new friend, she obsequiously hastened to allude to what
she felt sure must be a genuine grievance.</p>

<p>“An’ not a bit grateful, as you was a-sayin’ jist now!
She don’t remember, I shouldn’t think, all what you’ve
a-done for her. She don’t never make you no return
I d’ ’low. She don’t never give ’ee nothin’, do she?”</p>

<p>“Nothin’ to speak of,” retorted the other, peevishly, and
closed her mouth with a snap.</p>

<p>“Such as half a dozen fresh eggs, I suppose?” suggested
Mrs. Cross. “She wouldn’t ever give ’ee a fowl now, would
she? Would she?” she persisted, as Mrs. Chaffey did
not answer. “I shouldn’t think she’d ever give ’ee a fowl.
Lard, no, not a fowl—would she?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Chaffey was at length goaded into an answer.</p>

<p>“If she did it wouldn’t be so very much. I wouldn’t
think meself at all beholden to her—no, that I wouldn’t.
Seein’ that she’s got dozens of ’em a-runnin’ about her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>
place, I don’t think I need be so very thankful if she do
spare a couple every now an’ then, an’ a ham at Christmas,
wi’ all the pigs they’ve got.”</p>

<p>“A ham!” ejaculated Mrs. Cross. “A <i>ham</i>! Why,
they <i>must</i> be doin’ pretty well!”</p>

<p>“Well—not so bad,” conceded Mrs. Chaffey, very unwillingly.
“Connor, he did take a kind o’ little farm a few
year ago, a kind o’ dairy farm. They’ve a-got pigs an’
chickens an’ sich-like—a deal of ’em. I hope there mayn’t
be too many,” she added darkly. “I hope they mayn’t
be a-livin’ too free an’ a-spendin’ too fast. I hope not. I
hope there mayn’t be a day o’ reckonin’ comin’.”</p>

<p>She shook her head in an ominous manner, and Mrs.
Cross hastened to follow her example.</p>

<p>“They bain’t a-layin’ anything by, ye may be sure,”
she exclaimed conclusively.</p>

<p>A kind of spasm crossed the other lady’s face, and she
rose hastily, remarking that if she didn’t begin to straighten
up a bit she wouldn’t get the house put to rights before
bedtime.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cross took the hint, rose likewise, and backed
meditatively towards the door.</p>

<p>“Well, ’tis a strange tale what you’ve a-told I, Mrs.
Chaffey, an’ I do feel for ye terr’ble. As for that there
voolish——”</p>

<p>She paused suddenly, a slow grin dawning on her face.</p>

<p>“She don’t seem to ha’ done so very bad for herself,
after all,” she remarked, and vanished.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">SWEETBRIAR LANE.</h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">There</span> they go,” said Grandmother Legg, “a-marchin’
off together so happy as a king and a queen.”</p>

<p>Susan Ball, a visitor from the town, craned her head
round the door-post and gazed after the young couple
with interest. David Samson, a big broad-shouldered,
rather awkward looking young fellow was walking arm-in-crook
with Rebecca Yeatman, Mrs. Legg’s orphan granddaughter.
A little slender fair-haired thing, lissom and
graceful in all her movements was Rebecca—she looked
like an elf as she paced along beside her cumbersome
lover.</p>

<p>“They’ve a-been a-courtin’ a long time, haven’t they,
mum?” queried Miss Ball.</p>

<p>“They’ve a-been coortin’,” responded Grandmother Legg
emphatically, “since they was no higher than nothin’ at
all. Dear, yes! he’d come Sunday after Sunday same as if
they was reg’lar coortin’ folk, an’ Rebecca, she’d lay down
her doll, and fetch her hat, an’ walk off so serious as a
grown-up maid. Poor Legg—he had all his senses then
same as anybody else—he’d laugh fit to split he would.”</p>

<p>Miss Ball looked towards the chimney corner where
Grandfather Legg was now installed and received from
that worthy old gentleman a smile calculated to give any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>
weak-minded person a “turn,” accompanied by some unintelligible
remark delivered in a quavering treble. Miss
Ball, who was not troubled with nerves, smiled back at
him and nodded cheerfully.</p>

<p>“He haven’t got no wits at all now, mum, have he?”
she inquired parenthetically of Mr. Legg’s better-half.
“But we was a-talkin’ of Rebecca. I do ’low she an’
David ’ull be gettin’ married one o’ these days?”</p>

<p>Grandmother Legg screwed up her mouth and shook
her head dubiously.</p>

<p>“I don’t know I’m sure,” she replied. “David he’s not
earnin’ more nor ten shillin’ a week, nor likely to for a
good bit, and Rebecca, she wouldn’t be much good at
keepin’ house on such a little money. ’Tis a child, Miss
Ball, nothin’ but a child. There, if you was to see the
antics she do carry on wi’ David! I do truly wonder the
chap has so much patience wi’ her. Sweetbriar Lane is
where they do always go. ’Tis Coortin’ Lane, you know—so
they do call it hereabouts—and a-many do go a-walkin’
there of a Sunday an’ they do tell I that Rebecca
do seem to care for nothin’ but teasin’ and tormentin’ the
poor boy. Mary Vacher—e-es, ’twas Mary—did tell I
last week as she an’ her young man was a-walkin’ in
Sweetbriar Lane o’ Sunday and she did see our little maid
a-playin’ all manner o’ tricks on Davy. One minute she’d
be runnin’ round a haystack, then when the poor chap ’ud
run after her she’d trip off and hide behind an elder-bush.
Mary did say she’d go dancin’ from one place to another
just lettin’ him nearly catch her but poppin’ off the minute
he’d come close.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>“Well, there now,” commented Susan, “it do seem
childish, don’t it?”</p>

<p>“It be reg’lar nonsense I do tell her,” said Mrs. Legg
severely; then relaxing—“but Mary Vacher did say ’twas
really so good as a play to watch ’em. Her an’ her own
young man stood lookin’ arter ’em a long while, she said.
There, Rebecca ’ud go flyin’ up the path same as a bird or
a butterfly; an’ every now an’ again she’d stop and smile
round at Davy an’ beckon him, an’ off ’ud run poor Davy,
hammerin’ arter her so hard as he could, an’ just as he’d
be holdin’ out them great long arms o’ his off she’d go
again. An’ she’s real fond o’ him, mind ye—’tisn’t as if
she looked at anybody else.”</p>

<p>“Ye did ought to speak to her a bit sharp, mum,” said
Miss Ball severely, “you did ought to scold her for it.
They bain’t sensible, sich goin’s on.”</p>

<p>“Scold her!” ejaculated the other. “I mid just so well
speak to the wall. I mid just so well expect that there
settle to hear reason. She don’t mind me, what’s her own
grandmother, no more nor if I was the cat. She haven’t
got no respect for nothin’. I’ve see’d her pinch David’s
arm when they was a-walkin’ up the church steps one
day——”</p>

<p>“Never!” ejaculated the scandalised Susan.</p>

<p>“She did though! And she’ll carry on her antics up in
the churchyard yonder—you know the churchyard up
Sweetbriar Lane?—she’d as soon play off her tricks there
as on the Downs. Even when she was a little bit of a
maid she’d never run past the lychgate same as the other
children—she’d go a-swingin’ round the pillars or a-climbin’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>
on the trestles, or she’d maybe pop through the gate and
put her face up again the bars and dare David to kiss her.
He dursn’t go nigh the place, poor boy, an’ she knowed
that very well.”</p>

<p>“Well, well!” sighed Susan Ball, “I wouldn’t like to say
nothin’ unkind o’ your granddaughter, Mrs. Legg, but ’tis
to be hoped as she’ll not come to a bad end, mum.”</p>

<p>“’Tis to be hoped so,” agreed Mrs. Legg, “but there’s
no knowin’.” She echoed Susan’s sigh but smiled the
while; indeed it was evident that she looked on the misdemeanours
of Rebecca with a certain tolerance, one might
almost say satisfaction, as distinguishing her from the
ordinary run of maidens.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Rebecca and David, having finished a somewhat
discursive progress up Sweetbriar Lane, emerged on
the Downs beyond. Here Rebecca took up a position on
a sunny little gorse-crowned hillock and despatched him to
a neighbouring copse with orders to collect some of the
wild strawberries which grew there in abundance.</p>

<p>Nearly a score of journeys did David make to and from
that copse, while Rebecca fanned herself with a beech-branch
and gibed at him for his slowness.</p>

<p>“I do ’low you do eat more nor you do pick,” she remarked
at last.</p>

<p>David stood stock still, indignant and disheartened.</p>

<p>“There’s no pleasin’ ye!” he cried. “I haven’t so much
as ate one.”</p>

<p>“No more have I then!” exclaimed Rebecca; and uplifting
her beechen fan she proudly showed him a pile of
the ruddy berries neatly arranged on a flat stone beside her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span>“There, you be to eat ’em all!” she announced with an
imperative wave of the hand, “I did save ’em up for ye.”</p>

<p>“You must have half,” said he.</p>

<p>But Rebecca shook her head.</p>

<p>He sat down beside her on the short turf and placed the
stone between them.</p>

<p>“Certain sure you must have some of ’em,” he cried.
“I shan’t care to eat ’em if you don’t.”</p>

<p>“You be to eat ’em all,” reiterated Rebecca; “I’d like
to watch ye.”</p>

<p>“Nay now, you must taste one,” said David, and leaning
forward tenderly he endeavoured to force one into her
mouth. But thereupon Rebecca set her little white teeth,
jerked back her head, and uplifting a small but vigorous
hand slapped his face with all her might.</p>

<p>“I won’t have ’em neither then!” cried he, flushing hotly
and clambering to his feet. “You do go too far, you do.”</p>

<p>“I do go too far, do I?” retorted the freakish sprite.
“Let’s go home then.”</p>

<p>Too much wounded to protest, David turned about and
walked sulkily beside her as she tripped down the lane.</p>

<p>“A body never knows where to have ’ee, maidie,” he
complained after a pause. “There’s times when you do
seem so sweet as honey, and next minute I fair wonder if
you do care a pin for me.”</p>

<p>The two were now walking under a hedge so tall that
it almost arched over their heads; it grew on the summit
of the high bank which bordered one side of the lane. A
serried mass of greenery was this hedge; the star-like
foliage of maple mingling with the rougher, darker green<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span>
of hazel and guelder, while amid the stronger growths,
delicate trailing wreaths of dog rose and sturdy bushes of
wild sweetbriar flourished side by side. It was from this
latter that the winding path took its name. The sweetbriar,
indeed, grew so freely about the place that in the
summer time all the air was filled with fragrance.</p>

<p>Rebecca seemed not at all moved by her lover’s lament;
she gave a little laugh and continued the song she had
been humming to herself.</p>

<p>“There’s times,” continued David warmly, “when I do
truly think I’d do better to go off and coort some other
maid.”</p>

<p>“Well, and why don’t ye?” inquired Rebecca blithely.</p>

<p>“I don’t know but what I will,” cried he. “Most maids
’ud give ye a kind word back when ye speak ’em fair, and
’ud say thank ye when ye do make ’em a present, and ’ud
not go for to rub their cheeks after their sweetheart had
given them a kiss.”</p>

<p>This was indeed an offence which Rebecca committed
but too often. She darted from him now, and, approaching
the bank, made two little upward springs at the hedge,
bringing down with each a small trophy. One was a wild
rose, the other a tuft of sweetbriar.</p>

<p>“Look ye, David,” said she, “which do ye like best of
these two?”</p>

<p>“The sweetbriar o’ course,” cried he, recovering his
spirits at once at what he took to be a sign of softening on
her part, and his face wreathing itself with smiles as he
stretched out his hand for the little sprig.</p>

<p>Rebecca waited till he had taken hold of it, and then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span>
with a sudden malicious squeeze of both her little hands,
pressed his fingers close about the prickly stem.</p>

<p>“Ha’ done,” cried he in real displeasure, “that were a
spiteful trick and one as I didn’t expect from ’ee, Rebecca.
I d’ ’low I <i>will</i> go off and ha’ done wi’ it.”</p>

<p>As he spoke, however, he fastened the bit of sweetbriar
in his button-hole. Rebecca laughed and pointed to it.</p>

<p>“Sweetbriar has twice so many thorns as wild rose,” said
she, “but ye like it best for all that. An’ if ye do go
a-courtin’ any other maid ’twill be just the same. Ye’ll
come back to I.”</p>

<p>Taking hold of the lappet of his coat she sniffed at the
little sprig.</p>

<p>“Bain’t it sweet?” said she.</p>

<p>“’Tis sweet indeed,” returned he earnestly, and emboldened
by her unwonted softness he did what any other
lover under the circumstances would have done, and
Rebecca, after a pause, loosed his coat and deliberately
polished her cheek with her handkerchief.</p>

<p>Yet for all that David did not court another maid.</p>

<p>Not long after this the young pair were unexpectedly
parted. David had an uncle who was a large sheep-farmer
in Westmorland, and it was thought by all his
family a great opening for the lad when this well-to-do
and childless relative offered to take him into his employment.
Every one rejoiced at David’s good fortune except
David himself and his poor little sweetheart. Even he
was not so much broken-hearted as Rebecca. David
scarcely knew whether to be more afflicted or elated at
the girl’s despair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span>“I never reckoned you cared for I that much,” said he,
as they went for their farewell stroll up the lane.</p>

<p>She looked at him reproachfully without speaking, her
pretty blue eyes were drowned in tears, her mouth drooped,
her little face looked very white and pitiful.</p>

<p>“There I shouldn’t ha’ said that,” cried he remorsefully.
“Ye never loved anybody but me, did ye? An’ you’ll
always be true—won’t ye?”</p>

<p>“Always! always!” she sobbed—“faithful an’ true, David.
Whenever you do think of me you must always say that
to yoursel’. Rebecca was a teasin’ maid, you may think, but
she loved me an’ she’ll always love me—faithful and true.”</p>

<p>Then David in a kind of rapture of anguish, felt her
arms about his neck—such little, light, slender arms—and
her golden head sank upon his breast.</p>

<p>Before that time he had had many misgivings in thinking
of the two years that must elapse before they again
met, and had wondered to himself often if Rebecca would
be likely to stick to him when he was no longer at hand;
but now all such ignoble doubts died within him, and in
spite of the knowledge that the morrow must part him
from her, he was a proud and happy lad as he folded her
in his arms.</p>

<p>In two years he would come back—his uncle had said
he might come home for a holiday after two years. He
would earn a lot of money and meanwhile they would
write. They would often write; Rebecca wouldn’t be too
partic’lar about blots or spellin’, would she? No, Rebecca
was not in the mood to be particular about anything.
Then David would give his word to write often.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span>“An’ whenever ye see a bit o’ sweetbriar, ye’ll think o’
me?” said Rebecca.</p>

<p>Yes, he would think of her then and always.</p>

<p>“I do want the sweetbriar to remind you o’ me,” went
on the girl, “because—because—I reckon it’s like me—full
of prickles. I’ve often been a bad maid to ye, Davy,
haven’t I? Often an’ often I’ve pricked ye and hurt ye,
but I’ve loved ye all the time.”</p>

<p>And thereupon David assured her he didn’t mind the
prickles, and that there was nothing in all the world so
sweet as the sweetbriar, and then having reached the
top of the lane they kissed each other again and came
home through the scented dusk full of a melancholy happiness.</p>

<p>The memory of that hour comforted David during the
first weeks of separation, but as time went on the old
habit of jealous distrust reasserted itself in some measure.
Rebecca was a bad correspondent. The wilful little maid
had never taken much pains to make herself a scholar and
letter-writing was to her a matter of difficulty. David
would brood over each scanty ill-spelt scrawl, torturing
himself with doubts: Rebecca said so little—was she
already beginning to forget him? She was so pretty,
so gay—surely somebody else would “snap her up”
while his back was turned.</p>

<p>Yet now and then a little word in one of Rebecca’s
letters would make his heart thrill afresh with hope and
love, and he would be filled with remorse for his unworthy
suspicions. And when towards the end of autumn she
sent him a sprig of sweetbriar saying that “it would mind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span>
him of her,” he carried the thorny trophy in his breast
till it shrivelled and fell to pieces.</p>

<p>The northern winter was long and cold and the lad
thought regretfully many a time of genial Dorset with
its unseasonable flowers peeping out at all manner of
times, its gleams of sunshine and blue sky even on the
shortest days, the breeze rushing over the Downs, mild
for all its freshness, and carrying with it always a hint
of the sea not far distant. He dreamed of Dorset often,
of his father’s little homestead, of the farm on which he
had used to work, of the animals he had been wont to
tend, of the church to which he had betaken himself
Sunday after Sunday—but strangely enough, though he
longed and almost prayed to dream of Rebecca, the
vision which haunted his thoughts by day kept aloof
from his pillow.</p>

<p>One night, however, he did dream of Rebecca, and his
dream was so vivid that he could hardly believe that it
was not indeed reality. He thought he saw her standing
in the sunshine on the Downs at the top of Sweetbriar
Lane; he was toiling up this lane at some distance from
her, running, but after the manner of dreams, not seeming
to make much progress, and she kept afar off, waving one
little slender arm and calling:—</p>

<p>“I want you, David!” she cried. “Davy—Davy—I
want you!”</p>

<p>Her voice was ringing in his ears when he woke; the
sweat stood on his brow, and his heart was thumping
violently.</p>

<p>“If she do want me, I’ll go,” he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span>It was not yet six months since he had left home;
according to his contract another eighteen should elapse
before he took a holiday, yet he did not hesitate for a
moment. An unendurable longing was upon him; he was
drawn by an inexplicable force. Without pausing to
reflect on the possible consequences which might ensue,
he rose, dressed and set forth on his journey before any
one, even in that early household, was astir.</p>

<p>He had but little money, and his progress was necessarily
slow, his resources only permitting him to travel a
part of the way by train. He walked the rest, begging
occasional “lifts” from good-natured waggoners.</p>

<p>It was nearly a week after that dream had come to him
when he arrived late one afternoon at his native place. So
travel-stained was he, so haggard and gaunt with fatigue
and privations, that his old friends would have found it
difficult to recognise him had he traversed the village;
but Rebecca’s home lay on the outskirts and he made his
way there immediately.</p>

<p>His heart had been torn by a thousand conflicting hopes
and fears during his long journey. What if Rebecca did
not want him at all? What if she should laugh at him
for his pains? What if she should join in the chorus of
disapproval which would, he knew, greet his foolhardy
undertaking? His uncle had probably written home to
announce his disappearance; his parents would have plenty
to say on the subject, but for that he cared little. What
would Rebecca say? what would she think? And then
he remembered her parting words: “She’ll always love
me faithful and true,” and he seemed again to feel her
arms about his neck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span>His heart leaped up within him as he approached the
cottage, for he half-expected to see the elfin shape come
flitting forth to greet him; and then he chid himself for
his folly. How could she be on the look-out for him? he
had sent her no word of his coming.</p>

<p>It was a frosty night, clear and unusually cold. The
moon had already risen and the sky was spangled with
stars. He could see the withered hollyhocks standing
stiff on either side of the whitewashed flagged path, and
observed that the door was fast closed. A little glimmer
of firelight came through the kitchen window, but otherwise
there was no sign of life about the place.</p>

<p>Three strides carried David up the garden path and in
another instant his hand rattled at the latch; but the door
did not yield to his hand—it was bolted within and no
sound broke the succeeding stillness except the barking of
a distant dog and the tremulous beating of his own heart.</p>

<p>“Rebecca!” he cried. His voice was hoarse and his
great frame trembled like a leaf. “Rebecca! I’m here.
I be come.”</p>

<p>A shrill cackle from within—Grandfather Legg’s unmistakable
laugh—was the only response.</p>

<p>David’s hand dropped from the latch and he darted to
the kitchen window and peered in the room.</p>

<p>By the dim light of the fire he could make out the old
man’s form in its accustomed place, and rapped sharply
at the pane.</p>

<p>“Eh?” cried Grandfather Legg.</p>

<p>“Be every one out?” shouted David. “Where’s Rebecca?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span>The old man leaned forward so that the firelight fell
full upon his shrivelled face; his habitually vacant eyes
wore a cunning look and he laughed again, as though
amused by some secret joke.</p>

<p>David uplifted his voice once more and in his excitement
shook the little casement. “Look at me!” he
cried. “Don’t ye know me, Mr. Legg? It’s me—David
Samson.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I know ye,” chuckled Mr. Legg. “I know ye,
David.”</p>

<p>“Right!” cried David, delighted at having extracted an
intelligible response. “Then tell me where’s Rebecca?
I’ve come a long way to see her. Which way has she
gone? I be talkin’ of <i>Rebecca</i>, Mr. Legg.”</p>

<p>“E-es,” rejoined the other, still chuckling; “oh, e-es,
Rebecca—surely.”</p>

<p>“Where is she, I say?” shouted David.</p>

<p>Grandfather Legg lifted a lean hand and jerked his
thumb expressively in the direction of Sweetbriar Lane.</p>

<p>“Rebecca,” said he, “Rebecca be yon.”</p>

<p>David stepped back from the window and stood a
moment paralysed. The eager excitement of a few
moments before left him all in a minute and he became
suddenly cold. Rebecca was out at this hour—Rebecca
had gone a-walkin’ in Sweetbriar Lane with another man.
That dream which told him she craved for him was but a
mockery.</p>

<p>After a pause he began to walk rapidly away in the
direction indicated by the old man. He would see for
himself; he would find Rebecca and tax her with her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span>
infidelity; he would—here he drew in his breath and
clenched his hands—he would reckon with the other fellow.</p>

<p>Now the lane lay before him, winding upwards between
its shadowy hedges silent and deserted. His steps rang
sharply on the frozen surface; deep shadows lay beneath
the hedgerows but the path itself gleamed silvery white in
the moonlight. Up, up—there was never a soul in sight—if
Grandfather Legg spoke truth Rebecca must have
wandered on a long way with that new sweetheart of hers.
He pressed forward with what speed he might, he would
come upon them sooner or later and then!</p>

<p>Yonder at the turn of the lane, the outline of the lychgate
was visible, and, topping the churchyard wall the dark
heads of a group of cypresses; his eyes wandered absently
over them, insensibly taking note of how bravely the frost-encased
needles gleamed; the hoar lay thick on the ancient
tiles of the lychgate roof too, and even edged the time-worn
pillars which supported it. As he brought his absent gaze
down to these pillars he saw a face peep out at him from
behind one. The moonlight fell full upon it and he recognised
at once that it was Rebecca’s. Very small and pale
it looked, and yet it wore a smile, tender and a little sad.</p>

<p>David with an inarticulate cry rushed towards her. But
before he could reach it the little figure came gliding forth
from its ambush and went fluttering up the path before
him as it had so often done in former days. She paused
every now and then to turn round with the arch smile
which he knew so well, and to beckon, but she spoke no
word, and her feet fell so lightly on the stony track that
they made no sound. She wore a cotton dress familiar to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span>
David, and no wrap of any kind in spite of the cold; her
fair hair, too, glistened in the silvery light unshaded by a hat.</p>

<p>“Rebecca! Rebecca!” cried David, lumbering in pursuit
of her, a prey to such a tumult of emotions that he almost
wept. “Rebecca, come back, love. I came because ye
did call me. Ye must have a word to say to me sure.
Ye’ll never go for to treat me so foolish now I have come
all this way to see ye.”</p>

<p>But the little figure only waved its arms for all response
and went gliding on—on, always out of reach, now lost to
sight at the turn of the lane, now in obedience to some
such freakish impulse as had often roused his ire long ago,
darting behind a clump of bushes, now peering down at
him from the top of a high bank. Always tantalising,
always elusive, but his own Rebecca for all that—his
Rebecca who had never given a thought to any other man.
She would surely soon tire of her play and run to his arms.</p>

<p>Here were the Downs at last, and Rebecca, as though in
answer to his yearning, paused, turning towards him and
beckoning. For a moment he saw her thus almost as he
had seen her in his dream, save that the light which bathed
her slight figure was not the noonday glow of his fancy
but the ethereal radiance of the winter’s night, and that no
word passed her smiling lips. As he gazed upon her the
dream powerlessness came upon him, his feet remained
rooted to the ground, his arms hung useless by his side, he
tried to call her name aloud but his tongue clove to his
palate. Only a moment did this nightmare-like oppression
endure and then, with a cry, he rushed towards the spot
where she had stood—but Rebecca had vanished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span>His arms closed upon the empty air, his dazzled eyes
beheld only the frost-bound Downs, the clump of firs
against which he had seen her form outlined—there was
no trace of her anywhere. Calling upon her frantically,
first in anger, then with anguish, then in wild terror, he
searched about the place, but all was silence—desolation.</p>

<p>He came down the hilly path at last slowly, looking
neither to right nor to left, his head sunk upon his breast
and his figure swaying.</p>

<p>Here was the bank where she had picked that sprig of
sweetbriar to which she had likened herself; the leafless
bush coated with frost like its fellows gave forth no perfume
as he passed, and he did not even pause.</p>

<p>Now the lychgate came in sight once more, and David
quickening his pace ran unsteadily towards it. The gate
yielded to his hand, but no fairy form lay in ambush
behind it, no arch mocking face peered at him through
the bars. Yet as it swung to behind him David stood still,
catching his breath with a gasp; a rush of overpowering
perfume greeted his nostrils, here in the dead of the
winter’s night the frozen air was heavy with the scent
of sweetbriar. As he staggered forward with a choking
cry his feet sank deep in the soft mould of a newly-made
grave.</p>
